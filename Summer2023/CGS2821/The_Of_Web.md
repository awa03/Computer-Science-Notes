Modern browsers may even assist in the creation of webpages due to the use of developer tools. Developer tools allow the user to see the exact HTML a website is using to display its contents. Using the developer tools we can even see a complete list of all the files that are sent to the client when the page is loaded. 

If a file is incorrectly refrenced it may not appear on the page. This brings us to the importance of file management which can be seen in the following notes : [[File Management]]

Developer tools also allow the developer to see what a website will look like on diffrent screen sizes. This assists the user in solving the problem of mobile devices mentioned in [[How the Internet Works]]. This allows the developer to ensure proper web display no matter the device.
