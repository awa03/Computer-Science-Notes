<b>File Management</b> is essential to the working of a website. It is the most common issue that web developers face. Files for a website are stored similarly to how they are stored locally on your computer.

We must ensure we follow best pracitces (such as naming conventions) in order to ensure that files are ran properly. Never name files using special characters (% ,# ,^ , etc). Underscores and hyphens are ok however. Only use lowercase letters and numbers 1-9 to ensure a clean naming convention (best practice, however not essential to operation). This applys to folder names as well.

Use folders to logically organize the files within your website. These should contain like files (assets, pages, etc) in order to avoid confusion. The most common example of this is the images folder. Most websites seperate there images within a seperate file.
