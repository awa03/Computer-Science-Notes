The `<meta>` tag allows the user us used to declare the page author and any other relevant information, we separate keywords with a comma. 

Attributes are included in the opening tag and may modify it
`<meta name='' content=''>` 

The title element may change the name of the entire site. It is better to do this than the individual pages. If we would like to separate them into pages the syntax is as follows
`<title>Kay's Baking - Cupcakes</title>`
