<i>Scientific materialism</i> is at the opposite end of the theological spectrum from <i>biblical literalism</i>. They both discuss conflict between contemporary science an classical religious beliefs. Both don't have a sure foundation, and both claim that science and theology make rival literal statements about history if nature, etc. 

<strong>Scientific Materialism</strong>
Starts at science -> broad philosophical claims
David Hume; evolutionary naturalism 19th century
- Scientific method is the only reliable path to knowledge (epistemological)
- matter or energy is the fundamental reality in the universe (metaphysical)
- Linked by the assumption that only the entities with which science deals are real
Reductionism; laws and theories of all the sciences are reducible to physics and chemistry
All phenomena can be explained by actions of material components

<strong>Biblical literalism</strong>
- starts at theology -> scientific claims

<strong>Logical Positivism</strong>
1920's - 1940's asserted that scientific discourse provides the norms for all language 
The only meaningful statements are empirical propositions verifiable by sense data
Ethics, metaphysics, religion are not true or false
