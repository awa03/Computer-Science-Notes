<strong>Can We Perceive Reality?</strong>
The subject is not being told the entire story of reality, we are oblivious to ultra violet light, the magnetic fields, and forces around us. What if we don't see reality at all. 
- Brain edits out senses around us (blinking, breathing)
- This is an attempt to simplify the world around us (data compression)
- Capture fleeting between rapid movements of outside world (saccades)
- During rapid movement the perceiver is essentially blind
The brain transforms the outside world into what we perceive to be reality.

<strong>Color Blue</strong>
Blue is a property of the interaction that we have with it
Our brain perceives constructs allowing us to operate with our reality - VR 
Our brain and sensory system create a UI that simplify the world around us
We see things we need to see in order to survive (back to the movement)
- We cannot say we are seeing the truth

<strong>Is Your Perception of Reality The Same as Mine?</strong>
All humans have around the same brains and sensory systems
Conscious experience differs from person to person
We allow shortcuts so we can limit our brains perception, thus opening it up to fake news/ conspiracy

<strong>Why is my Reality Different?</strong>
1) You / I am being lied to
2) We seek out or interpret facts to fit our pre-existing beliefs
Motivated perception - Yuan Chang Leong - U.C Berkeley - Paid more for correct
Other studies suggest smell, taste, reasoning and memory are influenced too.
Money => Survival => Brain Perceives it => Biased Choice

<strong>Do we make Reality?</strong>
*"An electron, for instance, is  said to be in a superposition of many places at once because, like all quantum objects, it exists in a cloud of possibilities. These possibilities are encoded in a mathematical entity called the wave function, until it is measured. At that point, the wave function collapses and all the possibilities are reduced to one. The electron assumes a single, definite position or state – something we would recognize as real."*

<strong>Inanimate Objects</strong> 
IIT rejects the idea that consciousness is exclusive to humans and other complex organisms. It allows for the possibility of even inanimate objects to possess a rudimentary form of consciousness. 
- Cs - Fundamental property of matter => then no such thing as Pc universe 
- Subjectivity has recently begun to reassert its centrality in the making of  objective reality.

If wave function collapse is caused by observers updating their knowledge.
- There is no objective reality, only our subjective estimation of it.

- "What my approach claims is that physical reality is fundamentally observer-relative, but in an objective way,"
- Probabilistic law givens the impression of a physical world with laws of nature
- Experiences are not caused by physical reality, but compose it
- Resurrect idealism
