<strong>Pre Lecture Video Notes</strong>

An instruction is a command that hardware understands
- Instruction set is the vocabulary of commands understood by a given computer
- Included arithmetic instructions, memory access instructions, logical operations, instructions for making decisions

The general classes of MIPS instructions are
- Arithmetic
	- add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Logical
	- and, or, not, not shift
- Data transfer
	- load from or store to memory
- Transfer control
	- Jumps, branches, calls, returns

<h4>Arithmetic Instructions</h4>

- Each MIPS only performs on operation
- Each one must have 3 variables
- These variables can be the same
```
add a, b, c     # a = b + c;
add a, a, a.    # a = a + a

sub a, b, a   # f contains t0 - t1

# a = b - ((b+c) + a + a) 
```
- if the statement is more complex we need to break it into pieces

In MIPS, operands for general arithmetic operations must be from registers of constants
- 32 programmer useable registers
- Reflects <i>"Faster is better"</i>
Registers use less power

Name|Number|Use
-|-|-
`$zero`|0|Const 0
`$at`|1|Assembler temporary, for resolving pseudoinstructions
`$v0 - $v1`|2-3|Function results and expression evaluation
`$a0 - $a3`|4-7|Arguments
`$t0 - $t9`|8-15, 24-25|Temporary 
`$s0 - $s7`|16-23|Saved Temporary
`$k0 - $k1`|26-27|OS Kernel
`$gp`|28|Global pointer
`$sp`|29|Stack pointer
`$fp`|30|Frame pointer
`$ra`|31|Return address

More about how these work: [[Intro To MIPS]]
More about the use of these: [[Logical Operations]]

The general form for a mips instruction is
```
Instruction_mnemonic $target, $source1, $source2
```
- MIPS is case insensitive (not case sensitive) so `Add` can be `ADD` or even `aDd`

We donâ€™t have variables, we have registers.
