- Aggregation is the practice of combining classes into a larger more complex class
- Composition is implemented the same as aggregation but it is a stronger relationship

If you attempt to directly use a contained class that is associated with containing class by composition nm the expectation is that it will be hard and probably not make sense. All aggregation is composition but not all composition is aggregation, because composition allows the parts to work seperately.
