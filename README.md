This repository is a compilation of my notes from Florida State University. Within this compilation, I explore every aspect of computer science. Sections currently under work will be updated promptly. These Notes are not meant to provide benefit to any party, rather to be used as a resource for personal use. Per FSU Guidelines, these notes should not be bought nor sold. If any professor feels that this is a violation of their course policies, please contact awa22@fsu.edu

> The majority of this information is from learning in class; therefore, none of this information is strictly my own. For credits, all of the course teachers' names will be cited.

#### Studying for Fun

I would like to diversify my note set so I will also be adding sections for independent study notes. I will be covering multiple books and placing my notes in this section from now on. I hope that this section serves to build upon many of the notes taken in my undergraduate study areas, and can help others. All books used will be cited below, and all of these books can be found for free online.
