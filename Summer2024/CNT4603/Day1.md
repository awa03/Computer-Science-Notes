## Ip Address

**We can see our Ip:** `ipconfig` - ipv4
- This can also be found in many settings menus, or by looking up "what's my Ip" on your search engine

**IP stands for internet protocol**
 - We can compare an IP address to a home address, but for the internet
 - IPV4 is presented in dotted decimal notation, 32 bits, 4 bytes.
 - Every Set of numbers (separated by decimal) is 8 bits.
	 - `124.21.3.1` 

### What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** is the process of breaking an ip address into smaller networks and subnets
- This was created to resolve issues with the majority of ipv4 addresses being taken up
- There are 4.2 billion possible addresses

**Subnet mask** is a 32 bit address value 
- Gives us a way to breakup network into subnets
- See if devices are on the same network
- Like a filter for ip address's
- We can also find your subnet mask using `ipconfig`

### Gateway Address

- Network node that serves as an gateway for another network
- There are **public** and **private** ip addresses
	- Private - Information can only be sent or received within the network
	- Public - Allows for outside communication

#### Public
- Assigned by your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- Dynamic Address
	- Change over time
- Static Address
	- Remain the same
	
- **How Do We See If Its Public Or Private?** (Check Settings, DHCP / Automatic)
	- Is My Address static / Dynamic

## DNS (Domain Name System)

- Known as the phone book of the internet
- Essentially an alias for the IP address. In other words we will get Facebooks respected websites IP from "Facebook.com". This makes it so we don't need to type in and remember their IP
	- We can find our DNS server through the settings menu on your pc
