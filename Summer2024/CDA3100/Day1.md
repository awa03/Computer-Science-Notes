## Computer Organization

Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing are 
- A large collection of servers that provide services over a network
- They dynamically varying number of servers as a utility.

### Eight Great Architectural Ideas 
- Design for moores law
	- Use of this principle is limited by Dennard Scaling
- Use abstraction to simplify design
	- Abstraction is used to represent the design at different levels of representation
- Make the common case fast
	- Most cost efficient method to obtain
- Improve performance via parallelism
	- Improve performance by performing operations in parallel
- Improve via pipelining 
	- Break tasks into stages so that multiple tasks can be simultaneously performed in different stages
- Improve via prediction
	- Sometime faster to assume a particular result rather than waiting until the result is known
	- Known as speculation and is used to guess the result based on branches
- Use a hierarchy of memories 
- Improve dependability via redundancy

## Program Levels and Translation
- The computer actually speaks in terms of electrical signals, >OV is on OV is off
- This can be represented into 1 as on or 0 is off
- Data is represented as a significant collections of bits

The various levels of representation for a program are:
- High level language: human readable level at which programmers develop applications
- Assembly language: symbolic representation of instructions
- Machine language: binary representation of instructions understandable by the computer and executable by the processor

## Abstractions

- Allow us to think in terms of the natural language
- Improved productivity, Conciseness is key 
- Most important advantage to portability
