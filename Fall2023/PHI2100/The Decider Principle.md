A major decision - deciding on a college major a job or a marriage partner. Do you have a lot of choices?
- Wouldn't act as a shortcut for a major decision
A minor decision is not as important. An example is what pair of socks to choose. 

- High/Low variability decisions 
	- Low - options are relatively similar (for better or for worse)
	- High - options are drastically different
- High/Low resources  decisions

-|Low Variability|High Variability

Low Resources|Shortcut|Shortcut
High Resources|Shortcut|Chose

A high variability problem is not necessarily dangerous.  

<h3>High and Low Resource availability</h3>
- sometimes you don't have the resources to deliberate over your options
	- About to go off a cliff and you have to hit the break or the parking brake
	- You have narrowed the last multiple-choice question down to A or B, but you have 20 seconds to finish the test.

<h3>The Exception</h3>
- When you know you're going to face similar decisions repeatedly, you might deliberate. 
- Medium variability is assumed as well, it is a general rule of thumb not an iron rule of rationality.

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

Satisficing|Environmental|Deference
-|-|-
Any choice would be acceptable, good enough|Avoiding environmental impact|Revising A Shortcut, or abandoning it
Choosing between 3 movies that are equally okay|Not buying ice cream so you don't eat it|If your shortcut is suboptimal, reevaluating

Thoughtful is better: Generally and in the long run, thoughtful deliberation will yield the best results.

<strong>The Decider principle can get stuck in infinite regress</strong>
