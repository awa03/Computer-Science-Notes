<h3>BitKeeper</h3>

<h3>Git</h3>

- Different users maintain their own repositories
- No central repository
- Changes are stored as change sets
	- Tracks changes not versions
	- Merge in change sets or apply patches
- No need to communicate with a central server
- Faster
- No single point of failure
- Encourages participation and forking projects
- Submit changes for inclusion or rejection
