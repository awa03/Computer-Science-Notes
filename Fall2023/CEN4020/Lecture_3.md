<h1><strong>Agile Software Development</strong></h1>
Program specification, design and implementation are light and interleaved. The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with clients involved in versions specification and evaluation.

<h3>Why is it popular?</h3>
- Businesses operate in a fast changing requirement and its practically impossible to produce a set of stable software requirements
- Software has to evolve quickly to reflect changes that the business needs
- Agile development emerged in the late 90's and the aim was to reduce delivery time for working software systems.

<h1><strong>Agile Manifesto - 4 Values</strong></h1>
- <b>Individual and interactions</b> over processes and tools
	- agile helps them collaborate and solve any problems that may arise
- <b>Working Software</b> over comprehensive documentation
	- Agile values documentation, but values working software more
- <b>Customer Collaboration</b> over contract negotiation
	- Agile enables the coordinated teams to align better with the customer requirements
- <b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan
	- Agile adapt quickly in order to deliver a quality product and ensure their clients satisfaction 

<h1><strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong></h1>
- A very influential agile method, developed in the late 1990's 
	1) Select user stories for this release
	2) break down stories into tasks
	3) plan release
	4) develop/ integrate / test
	5) release software
	6) evaluate system
<b>Repeat the above proceess...</b>

Practice|Description
-|-
Incremental planning|Plan in small parts and continue the cycle
Small releases|Release small portions at a time
Simple Design|Make each design a simplistic component that builds to a large complex one
Test-first development|Requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed
Refactoring|Make Changes Based on these 

<b>A member of the end-user of the system should be available full time for advising the XP team</b>
- Technical focus and is not easy to integrate with management practice in most organizations
- Consequently, when agile development uses practices from X, the method as originally defined is not widely used.
- User requirements are expressed as user stories or scenarios
- Written on cards and the development team break the down into implementation tasks. These tasks are the basis of schedule and cost estimates.

<h3>Refactoring</h3>
- Conventional wisdom in software engineering is to design for change. It is worth spending time and effort anticipating changes.
- Programming team looks for possible improvements and make them where ever they are needed
- Improves the understandability of the software and so reduces the need for documentation
- Changes are easier to make because the code is well-structured and clear
- However, some changes requires architecture refactoring and this is much more expensive.

<h3>Examples of Refactoring</h3>
- Re-organizing a class hierarchy to remove duplicate code
- Tidying up and renaming attributes and methods to make them easier to understand
- The replacement of inline code with calls to methods that have been included in a program library

<h3>Test-First Development</h3>
Testing central to XP and XP has developed an approach where the program is tested after every change that has been made
- Writing tests before code clarifies the requirements to be implemented
- Tests are written as programs rather than data so that they can be executed automatically. The test includes a check that it has executed correctly.
- All previous and new tests are run automatically when new functionality is added thus checking that the new functionality has not introduced errors.

<h1><strong>Pair Programming</strong></h1>
- Pair programming involves programmers working in pairs, developing code together.
- This helps develop common ownership of code and spreads knowledge across the team
- It serves as an informal review process
- Swap frequently 
- Usually pair with someone of different experience level 
- Takes longer / more effort than single programming, however may yield higher quality code

<h1><strong>Scrum</strong></h1>
- Scrum is an agile framework that focus on managing iterative development
- The scrum team consists of 3 role:
	1) Product Owner
	2) The Development Team
	3) Scrum Master
- <b>The Scrum Master</b> represents the products stakeholders and the voice of the customer. They create a prioritized, dynamic wish list (user stories) called a product backlog and is the sole person responsible for managing it
- The starting point for planning is the <b>product backlog</b>. which is the list of work to be done for the project
- The role of the Scrum Master is to protect the development team from external distractions
- The team attends <b>Daily Meetings</b> where all team members share information, describe their progress since the last meeting, problems that have arisen and what is planned for the following day.
