<h1><strong>Requirements</strong></h1>
The aim of the requirements is to answer the question
	<i><strong>What must the product be able to do</strong></i>
- We must determine what the client needs
	- Misconception - We must determine what the client <strong>needs</strong>
	- Ex. The client wants a faster software, but the real problem is the database is poorly designed
<h3>High-Level Requirements</h3>
- Give a general description of what it is the system should do
<h3>Low Level Requirements</h3>
- How the system should accomplish these goals
<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
- Specifies an action that the software product must be able to perform
- often expressed by inputs and outputs
- Shouldn't be too vague
	- Calendar - bad example
<h3>Nonfunctional Requirements</h3>
- How the system is supposed to be, the constraints
- Time, ability, scalability, security, reliability
- Shouldn't be too vague
	- Fast, pretty, dark mode - bad example
- Some may have to wait until later workflow

<h2><strong>Requirements engineering</strong></h2>
1) Requirements elicitation
	- Research and discovering the requirements
	- Accomplished through discussion with stakeholders and dev team
	1) Sufficiently understand the application domain and terminology
	2) Discover the real requirements of the stakeholders
	3) Group-related requirements and organize them
	4) Prioritize the requirements and resolve requirements conflicts
	5) Document requirements
2) Requirements specification
3) Requirements validation

<strong>Stakeholders</strong>: any person who is affected by the system in some way and has a legitimate interest
- Client, players, retailers, community

<h3>Application Domain</h3>
- Represents the context/environment in which the application is intended to operate
	- Banking, Education, Game, Etc
- We can't fully understand the application domain
<h3>Requirements Discovery</h3>
- The process of gathering information about required and existing systems
- Interaction with stakeholders is from managers
- Formal or informal interviews with stakeholders are part of most RE processes
	1) Structured interviews, preplanned questions
	2) Unstructured interviews, conversation
	3) Semi-structured interviews, preplanned and conversation
<h3>Types of Interview Questions</h3>
<strong>Open Ended</strong> - Require a specific answer
<strong>Close Ended</strong> - are posed to encourage the person being interviewed to speak out

<h3>Observational Method - <strong>Job Shadowing</strong></h3>
- Observing users or stakeholders
- <strong>Two Types...</strong>
	1) Passive Observation - The analyst watches someone working but does not interact with them in any way
	2) Active Observation - where an analyst asks questions through the process to make sure he understands
<h3>Prototyping/Mockups</h3>
- provide visual representations of a system that are used to elicit, analyze, and validate requirements
- They only exhibit the key functionality
- Humans are better at recognizing if a solution is correct than solving a problem from a blank page. Help explore uncertainty in the requirements
