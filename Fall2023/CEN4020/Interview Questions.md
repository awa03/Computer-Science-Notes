>[!Question] What is "Agile Software Development" and what are your thoughts on it?
> Agile Software Development is an iterative and flexible approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability to change, and customer feedback. It aims to deliver small, incremental releases of software, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and improve the product continuously.

>[!Question] How do functional requirements differ from non-functional ones?
>Functional requirements are about input and output, the ways in which the user interacts with the system. The non functional requirements are about how, by defining characteristics and qualities of a system. Examples of each being security, non functional, and data validation, functional.

> [!Question] What are your thoughts on software testing?
> Software testing is important because it ensures the reliability of a product. Software testing allows for the identification of bugs, which can assist in ensuring the product lives up to the products requirements. Also go into black box and white box testing...

>[!Question] What is the difference between Verification and Validation?
> Verification is the process of checking that a system or component meets specified requirements. It involves activities such as reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs to ensure that the design and implementation of the software meet the specified requirements.Validation is the process of evaluating a system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements. It involves dynamic testing, which means executing the software to ensure that it behaves as expected.
