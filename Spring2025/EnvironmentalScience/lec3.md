### Basic Concepts of Population Dynamics
- Population Dynamics
	- A general study of population changes
- Population
	- Group of individuals of the same species living in the same area
- Species 
	- All individuals that are capable of interbreeding
	- A species is made up of a population
- Demography
	- Statistical Study of human populations
- Five Key properties of any population
	- Abundance 
	- Birth rates
	- Death rates
	- Growth rates
	- Age structure
- Human population data often reported as crude rates (per 1000) people
	- 2 births per 1000 people

### Kinds of Population Growth
- Exponential growth
	- A population increasing by a constant percentage per unit time
- Human population growth peaked at 2.1%
	- 1965-1970 with rapid improvement of healthcare and food production
- Now growth is at 1.2% 
	- Slowing in wealthy industrialized nations but still increasing in many less-developed nations

### History of Human Population Growth
- _Stage 1_
	- Few million
	- Hunter Gatherers
- _Stage 2_
	- Rise in Agriculture 
	- Allowed for an increase in population density 
	- Total population 5 million in 10,000 B.C. to about 100 million in A.D 
	- From A.D.1 to A.D. 1,000 the population increased to 200-300 million
- _Stage 3_
	- Industrial Revolution
	- Improvements in health and food security 
	- Total population about 900 million (1800) doubling to 3 billion by 1960
- _Stage 4_
	- Currently
	- Now over 8 billion
- __Saltaire (U.K.)__
	- Built in 1851 by Sir Titus Salt
	- Largest industrial building in World
	- Built houses vs slums in Bradford
	- Wash-houses, bath-houses
	- Hospital
	- Library, concert hall, etc
- __Exponential growth and doubling time__
	- Time required for a population to double in size
	- $\frac{growthRate}{70}$ (Rule of 70)
	- Changes quickly as growth rate changes

### Analyzing & Estimating Future Population Growth
- Growth cannot continue forever (exponential growth)
- Logistic growth
	- S-shaped curve
	- Growth increases exponentially to inflection point
	- Reaches an upper population limit at logistic _carrying capacity_
- Little evidence animal population follow these rules
- Involves assumptions of
	- Constant Environment 
	- Constant Carrying Capacity
	- Homogeneous population
- Unlikely if death rate continues to decrease
- The most important statistic is __total fertility rate__
- What controls the __Total Fertility Rate__
	- Social Factors: cultural expectations, economic issues
	- Technical factors: access to birth control, economic resources
- First child decisions:
	- Lengthen time between generations: slow growth
- UN Projections of Human Growth
	- Based on potential fertility rates

### Age Structure
- Exponential and logistic growth curves ignore characteristics of the environment that affect different age groups
	- Food, water, shelter, disease
- _Age structure_
	- Express how populations is divided among age groups
	- Implications for current and future social and economic conditions 
	- Impact on the environment 
- __Type 1__
	- _Pyramid_: Population with many young and high death rate (short average lifetime)
	- Social impacts of a high dependency ratio (young): infrastructure costs (education), impacts on economy
- __Type 2__
	- _Inverted Pyramid_: population with large elderly population and small youth (declining growth)
	- Medical costs: current working population -> current retirees
- __Type 3__
	- _Column_: birth rate and death rate are low, little change in population size
- __Type 4__
	- _Column with bulge_: event in the past caused a high birth rate for some age group

### Demographic Transition
- Three stage pattern of change in birth rates and death rates
	- A multistage pattern of change in birth rates and death rates
	- Occurred during the process of industrial and economic development of Western nations
	- Leads to decline in population growth rate
- The demographic transition is not the same all around the world

### Longevity & Its Effect on Population Growth
- Maximum lifetime 
	- Maximum possible age to which an individual in a species can live (125 yrs?) 
- Life expectancy
	- Average number of years an individual in a species can expect to live
	- Higher in developed, prosperous nations
	- Japan: Highest (84.6 yrs)
	- Central African Republic: Lowest at 45.9
- Population growth occurred in human history with little change in maximum lifetime
- Modern Medicine has reduced death rates
- Acute diseases 
	- Appears rapidly in the population and then disappears
	- Currently 60% of mortality in Ecuador, <20% in the United States
- Chronic Diseases
	- Always present in population (cancer, heart, etc)
	- These figures have changed throughout history

### Human Population Effects on Earth
- Impact that all humans pose on the environment is a result of two factors
	- Number of people 
	- Impact of each person on the environment 
- T = P x I
	- _T_: total impact of the human population on environment 
	- _P_: population size
	- _I_: average environment impact per person
- Modern technology increases the use of resources and enables us to impact the environment in new ways 
- T = P x I equation is ironic 
	- Improving standard of living declines P
	- But at the same time I increases so counters the benefit
- __How many people can live on Earth at the same time?__
	- Depends on the quality of life people desire and are willing to accept
- Estimation methods
	- Extrapolation from past growth
	- Packing problem approach
	- Deep ecology
- Limiting Factors
	- _Short term_: affect population immediately
	- _Intermediate term_: affect population 1-10 years
	- _Long term_: effects not apparent until after 10 years (soil erosion, decline in ground water)
