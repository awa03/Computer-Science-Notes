### Habitable Earth
- Earth is unique (at least within our solar system) in its ability to sustain complex life
- What is needed for complex life?
	- Temperatures that permit liquid water
	- An oxygenated atmosphere

### Water
- Forms the basis of all life forms on earch
- Can dissolve many substances more than most other liquids, enables key chemical reactions in cells
- Allows cells to use nutrients, minerals, and chemicals in biological processes

### Oxygen
- Key factor in the habitability of planets
- Essential for the existence of life on earth
- _Energy source_: living organisms store energy in molecules (fat, sugars, etc), release energy when combined with oxygen
- 21% of earths dry atmosphere
- Almost completely absent in early earth
- 3.5 billion years ago mostly _nitrogen_ and _carbon dioxide_.
	- Only found in small concentrations
	- Reacted with other chemicals rapidly moving form the atmosphere
	- Cyanobacteria (__first algae__)
		- conducted photosynthesis
	- $C0_2$ levels in atmosphere gradually decreased and $O_2$ increased, allowing for life

### System
- _A network of relationships, parts elements and or components that interact and influence one another through the exchange of energy, matter, and/or information_
- Functions together to act as a __whole__
	- Responds to inputs and outputs
- Earth's system examples
	- Processes that change landscape (erosion, substrate movement)
	- Species interactions
	- Cycle Chemical interactions
- Two General Types of Systems
	- __Open System__: some energy or material moves into or out of system
	- __Closed System__: no such movements occur, doesn't change any matter with its surroundings
- __Static System__
	- Fixed condition
	- System stays in that condition
- __Dynamic Condition__
	- Changes (over time), often continually

### Stability or Steady State 
- __Stable System__
	- Condition that remains, unless disturbed
	- If disturbed it returns to the same condition and the cause of disturbance stops
- Steady state is not attained or maintained for a very long time

### Basic System Concepts
- __Dynamic Equilibrium__
	- The steady state that all natural systems move towards without the influence of people
	- Seldom attained or maintained for long
- __Linear Flow__
	- if you add the same amount of anything to a compartment in a system, the change will always be the same
	- if you add salt to a glass of water the salinity will increase linearly
- __Non Linear Flow__
	- The effect of adding a specific amount of something changes depending on how much has been added before
	- If you add 10 wolves to a forest, the amount of deer that they will eat will depend on the number of wolves already present in the forest
- __Lag Time__ 
	- The delay between a cause and the appearance of its effect
- __Average Residence Time__
	- How long on average a quantity will remain in a reservoir of a system
	- Equal to reservoir size divided by the rate of output
### Exponential Growth
- Related to
	- Rate of growth measured in %
	- Doubling time in years
- EG is positive feedback and incompatible with sustainability

### Feedback loops
- Occur when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause and effect that causes a loop or circuit
- __Feedback__
	- When on part of system changes
	- These affect another part of the system
	- Which then affects first change
- __Negative Feedback__
	- Increase in output leads to later decrease
	- Move the system in opposite direction
	- Neutralizes and stabilizes the system
- __Positive Feedback__
	- Drives system towards an extreme
	- an increase in output leads to a further increase in output
		- Destabilizing
	- More growth, people have more children, more output, destabilizes

### Earths Temperature Regulation
- _Negative Feedback_
	- Warmer temperatures cause ice to melt over the tundra
	- More plants can grow
	- Plants use up $CO_2$, causing earth to cool
- _Positive Feedback's_
	- Colder temperatures will lead to growth of the polar ice caps
		- Ice reflects more light back into space than land and sea
		- More light is reflected to space, earth cools further
	- Warmer temperatures lead to increased water vapor in atmosphere (humidity higher)

### Elements
- What are the most abundant elements on earth?
	- Oxygen (air)
	- Hydrogen (water)
	- Silicon (crust)
	- Carbon (living)
