# Critical Thinking in Environmental Science

- Scientific understanding of life and its environment is based on scientific method
- The Scientific Process is:
	- A way of knowing
	- Results in conclusions, generalizations and sometimes scientific laws
	- Allows us to explain a phenomenon and make predictions (based on knowledge at the present time)
- Continuous process
	- Sometimes a science undergoes a fundamental revolution in ideas
- Science begins with observation
- Deals only with statements that can be disproven
	- A statement can be deemed scientific if someone can state a method by which it could be disproved
	- A statement is considered nonscientific if no one can think of a test to falsify it
- Science is a process of _discovery_
	- Continuing process who's essence is change in ideas 
	- Events in the natural world follow patterns that can be understood through careful observation and scientific analysis

## Observations, Facts and Inferences
- _Observations_:
	- Made by any of the five sense (empirically) or instruments that measure beyond what we sense
- _Inference_
	- Generalization that arises from a set of observations
- _Fact_
	- Observation about a particular thing agreed upon by all

## Hypothesis 
- Type of statement used
	- What scientists seek to test and inference
	- Can be disproved
- If a hypothesis has not been disproved
	- It is still not proven true
	- Only found to be probably true
- Test the hypothesis that: A plant can only use so much light and no more - it becomes saturated by an abundance of light

## Controlling Variables
- A valid scientific experiment keeps all variables constant, except the independent and dependent variables
- Controlled Experiment
	- An exact duplicate of an experiment is compared back to a standard or control
	- One variable is altered (independent variable)
	- This may cause a change in another variable in the experiment (dependent variable)
- _Dependent Variable_
	- Dependent on the independent variable, a variable being observed and measured during an experiment. 
	- Plant growth Experiment: Height of Plant
- _Independent Variable_
	- A variable that is changed or controlled by the experimenter in order to observe its effects on the dependent variable 
	- Plant growth Experiment: Sunlight
- _Manipulated Variable_
	- Another Term For the Independent variable, as it is the variable the experimenter manipulates
- _Responding Variable_
	- Another Term For the Dependent variable, as it is the variable that responds to the manipulated variables changes.

## Data
- _Quantitative_
	- Numerical
	- EX: Diameter of Tree Trunk
	- EX: Mass in Grams of Plant
- _Qualitative_
	- Non Numerical
	- EX: Species of a tree
	- EX: Color of a lime

## The Nature of Scientific Proof
- The Scientific reasoning combines both deductive and inductive reasoning
- Deductive reasoning
	- Involves reasoning from initial definitions and assumptions
	- Science requires both logical reasoning and correct premises

## Deductive Reasoning
- If 1 = 2 (_premise_)
- and 2 = 3 (_premise_)
- then 1 = 3 (_conclusion_)
- __Premises__
	- A straight line is the shortest path between two points
	- The line from A to B is the shortest distance between points A and B
- __Conclusion__
	- Therefore, the line from A to B is a straight line
- Proof using deductive reasoning, does not require that the premises be true, only that the reasoning is foolproof

> [!My Note]
> First of all I dont like the use of numbers instead of variables, but why not use the Socrates example
> <blockquote>All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal</blockquote>

## Inductive Reasoning
- Generalizations based on a number of observations
- EX: Breeding male grebes have golden feathers
- True until we observe a male grebe that does not have golden feathers
- Proof of inductive reasoning is stated in terms of probability of occurrence

## Models and Theory
- Model
	- A deliberately simplified construct of nature
- Types
	- Physical working model
	- Pictorial model
	- Set of math equations
	- Computer model
