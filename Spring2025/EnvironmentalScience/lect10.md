# Coral Reefs
- cover in caribbean declined by >80%
- _Hermatypic Corals_ - Reef building corals
   - tend to live deeper, dont form reefs
- Hermatypic grow in the absence of free-living planktonic prey
- _Zooxanthellae_: symbiotic algae
- what does coral get in return?
  - organic carbon (sugars)
    - 90 - 99% carbon is transffered to host
    - Increased calcification (growth)
  - Removal of Phosphate
- Zooxanthellae can live outside of the corals for a period of time
  - allows them to transfer hosts
  - bleaching is the removal of them
- corals are slow growing
  - thus, slowly recover from damage
- corals compete for light and space
- _overgrowth_: some grow out shading other corals
- _overtopping_: some grow rapidly up to gain light and throw shadows over others
- _direct competition_: some have poisonous tentacles that digest their neighbor's directly
- corals are colonial organisms composed of zooids
- sexual reproduction by mass spawning and asexual reproduction
- __Environment__
  - topical temperatures
  - light
  - hard substrate
  - low nutrients
  - salt water
  - non stagnant water
  - oxygen
- fish serve primary herbivores
  - feed on algae, could otherwise compete for space
  - reef fish are often territorial
  - use the reef for protection and food
- the sea urchin diadema is another herbivore that helps keep algae in check
- crown of thorns starfish preys upon coral
- corals have dynamic places
  - respond well to natural climate change
  - human action has put them in danger
