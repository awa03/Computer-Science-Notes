# Lecture 1
- Stage 1
  - Early period of hunter and gatherers
  - total population < a few million
- Stage 2
  - Rise in agriculture
  - allowed for increase in population density and increase human populations
  - total population 5 million in 10,000 bc to about 100 million in A.D. 1 from A.D. 1000 the population increased to 200-300 million
- Stage 3
  - industrial revolution
  - improvements in health and food security led to rapid increase in  population
  - Total population about 900 million in 1800, doubling in a century and then 3 billion by 1960
- Stage 4
  - currently
  - allowed for increase in population density and increase in the human population
  - now over 8 billion
- Logistic growth
  - s shaped curve
  - growth increases exponentiall only temporarily to the inflection point
- most important statistic in population growth is _total fertility rate_
- Four types of population
  - Pyramid: population with many yound and high death rate (_short average lifetime_)
  - Inverted pyramid: population with a large elderly population and small youth (_declining growth_)
  - Column: birth rate and death rate are low, little change in population size
  - Column with bulge: event in the pat caused a high birth or death rate for some age group
- __Human Carrying Capacity__ limiting factors
  - short term: affect population immediately
    - food shortages
  - intermediate: affect population for 1-10 years
    - desertification
    - dispersal of pollutants
  - long term: effects not apparent until after 10 years

# Lecture 6
- energy is the capacity to do work
- connot be created or destroyed
- can be converted from one form to another
  - kenetic energy
  - potential energy
    - positional energy (gravitational)
    - energy in kenetic bonds
    - energy in electromagnetic radiation
- __first law of thermodynamics__: the total amount of energy in the universe is constant
- __second law__: every energy transformation increases disorder (entropy)
  - more usable forms to less usable forms
  - least usable form is _heat_
    - random motion of molecules
- __Electromagnetic Radiation__: light
  - amount of energy is determined by the wave length
  - the full range of wavelengths is called the spectrum
  - uv radiation has a shorter wave length
- __Heat__: another form of energy
  - flows from a higher temp body to a lower temp body
  - related to _temperature_
    - $tempChange * mass$
  - conduction: direct transfer
  - convection: regions of gas or liquid rise
  - radiation: matter loses heat by radiation, producing electromagnetic energy
  - latent heat transfer: associated with phase transitions (melting, freezing, etc)
- __chemical energy__: potential energy associated with the formation or breakage of bonds between atoms
- photsynthesis converts energy
- Nuclear energy: energy contained within an atoms nucleus
  - $E = mc^{2}$
  - Nuclear fission: splitting the nucleus
  - Nuclear fusion: combining two nuclei
- (energy) if the amount going in is greater the earth will heat
- a small increase in temperature will lead to a large increase in energy
- earths energy balance
  - slight imbalance lead to temperature changes
  - some of the light from the sun is reflected (30%)
  - the other 70% is absorbed
    - the portion that can heat up our planet
- what causes imbalances
  - reflectivity
  - insulation
  - absorption
- Greenhouse gasses
  - clear to visible light
  - absorb infared radiation
  - let energy come in, prevent it from leaving
  - Water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide, etc
- Albedo, the reflectivity of an object
  - snow is very reflective
  - sea ice as well is very reflective
  - clouds
- Atmospheric circulation
  - the sun rays strike different parts of the earth at different angles
  - sunlight reaching tropical regions arrive nearly perpendicular to the surface
  - sunlight reaching polar regions arrive at a very oblique angle, which is spread over a larger area
    - provides less energy per unit area
  - causes seasons
- in polar regions the outgoing long wave (heat) radiation is greater than the incoming short-wave (solar) raditation
- in tropical regions the outgoing long wave radiation is less than the incoming short wave radiation
- fluid motion transports heat around the globe (why we arent seeing large spikes rather a average out)
- How atmospheric circulation works?
  - density (__mass / volume__)
    - usually constant for solids
    - density can change with pressure
  - less dense fluids want to rise above
    - water boiling example
    - hot air balloons
- spinning planet exerts an apparent force called the _Coriolis effect_
  - moving ball thrown on merry-go-round
- Storms
  - areas of surface heating lead to rising air
  - causes humid air to condense, expanding
  - cools air, precipitation
- formation and sustence of hurricanes requires hot oceanic water
- Oceanic circulation
  - _surface current_: wind driven
    - rapid
    - high variable
  - _deepwater flow_: thermohaline circulation
    - oceanic overturning
    - much slower (over 10000 years)
- Wind driven circulation
  - wind transfers some of its energy through friction
  - Coriolis effect turns the water to the right
  - oceanic influenced by the shape of continents that prevent water from transiting the entire globe
- _Gyre_: A large system of rotating ocean current

# Lecture 7
- __Element__: a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances
  - composed of atoms that have the same atomic number
  - which means they have the same number of protons in their nucleus
  - Carbon
  - Hydrogen
  - Oxygen
  - Nitrogen
- __Isotope__: Atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons
  - different isotopes of an element will behave very similarly but have crucial differences in fractionation and chemical reaction rates
  - some isotopes are radioactive, meaning they will spontaneously decay or break apart (_releasing energe_)
- __Ion__: Electrially charged molecules or atoms
- __Covalent bonds__: strong bonds formed by sharing electrons
  - can be equal sharing
  - or unequal
