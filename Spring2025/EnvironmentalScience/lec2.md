- Science and Values

### Human Population Growth

- 35,000 years ago: ~3,000,000
- 12,000 ya: ~15,000,000
- 2,000 ya: ~100,000,000
- __Malthusian Population Growth__ 
- Population growth in the _absence of resource limitation_
- Growth is proportional to the population
- Equivalent to doubling at fixed intervals
- Natural populations grow exponentially until they reach their carrying capacity
- _Carrying Capacity_: the number of people, other living, or crops that a region can support

#### What Happens When a Population Reaches this Capacity
- It reaches a logistic curve, staying under carrying capacity
- If shot over then a rapid decline will occur
- Carrying capacity is the maximum number of plants, animals, bacteria, etc that an environment can sustain
- _Carrying Capacity_ is not fixed
	- health of ecosystem
	- resource utilization
	- technology
	- quality of life
- Humans carrying capacity estimates are variable (1-40 billion)

### Sustainability
- Sustainability of a resource
	- Harvesting no more than is replaced
- Sustainability of an ecosystem
	- Human stressors
	- Natural disturbances
	- Ecosystem resilience
	- Biodiversity
- __What would sustainability look like?__
	- Live without conflict with nature
	- Minimize pollution and risk
	- Restrained use of resources
	- Political system support
	- Minimize use of non renewable resources

### A Global Perspective
- Local actions have distant consequences
- Remote regions are linked by atmosphere and water
- DDT - 1962
	- Industrial Pesticide
	- Long half life in soils
	- Transported by runoff and rivers
	- Bio-accumulates
	- Linked to declines in aquatic life and birds
	- Human toxicity
- The ozone hole
	- Protects from UV rays
	- Destroyed by refrigerants
	- Over Antarctica

### An Urban World
- Worldwide cities growing rapidly
- Positives and negatives for environment
- Can be more efficient
- Less land per person
- Reshapes land drastically

### People and Nature
- Humans are a product of nature, and have been shaped by and have always shaped nature
- Prehistoric humans likely drove most large mammal species in North America to extinction
- Invented agriculture, reshaped ecosystems
- What is the natural world
	- Nature is always in a form of flux
	- What is the natural form?
	- Changed over time
- What steps should we take to protect

### Science and Values
- Decision making relys on:
	- Personal values
	- Human equality
	- Economic Progress 
	- Future Generations
	- Science
	- Assessing uncertain outcomes
- Scientific knowledge is _always_ being challenged
- Theories can be disprove, but never proven
- The classic scientific method is:
	- Observe phenomena
	- Formulate a question
	- Develop a hypothesis
	- Make predictions from hypothesis
	- Conduct experiment (tests) with potential to disprove hypothesis
	- Analyze results
- The _Precautionary Principle_
	- States when there is a threat of serious, irreversible environmental damage we should not wait for proof before taking precautionary actions
	- It is better to err on the side of not destroying the earth
	- Why do we value the earth?
