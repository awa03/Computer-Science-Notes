# Carbon Cycle

### Photosynthesis
- Carbon uptake by plants (the harvesting of light energy into chemical bond energy)
- $CO_2 + H_{2}0 = CH_{2}0 + 0_2$
- a high energy compound, organic matter, $CH_{2}0$ is short for carbohydrate and includes glucose
- primary production
- Carbon fixation
- the base of the food web

1. Sunlight to power it
2. nutrients to provide complete building blocks of life
   - nitrogren (forms are nitrate and ammonia)
   - P (phosphorus, in the form of ${PO_{4}}^3$)
     - used for ATP, energy transfer
   - others in the form of Silicon, iron, pottasium
- _Nutrient Recycling_ also called emineralization is the process of releasing the nitrate and ammonium as well as phosphate back into the environment
- _Fixation_: going from a gas to a particulate solid form
    - generates biomass
- _Heterotrophic respiration_: microbial respiration, demoposition, animal respiration
- _Autotrophic respiration_: has the same equation

### Life forms

- _Autotroph_: self feeding,uses energy from the sun to fix carbon. Primary producers
- _Heterotroph_: eats others. obtains energy from eating plants (herbivore, seocondary producers) or animals that have eaten plants, carnivore, teriary producer
- 10% energy transfer 90% loss (generalization)
- in the dark respiration gives off $CO_{2}$ from the earths surface back to the atmosphere. This is also a __FLUX__
- for aquatic: respiration and photsynthesis work the same ways in both systems.
- _biomass_ = standing stock of living matter
- _production_: new growth of living matter
- if production = death than biomass is at a steady state
- steady state inputs = outputs. No change in amount.
- Biomass has units of mass per area : mass / area
- production has units of mass per area per time : Mass / (area * time)
- if input = output - resevoir is at steady state
- residence time is amount of biomass (mass / area) / input
- mass / (area * time) = units of time
- residence time is also called turnover time

### Transfer of organic carbon from plants to soil
- represents transfer of carbon to living pool to dead carbon pool, solid organic matter
- can take place from learf fall (litter) to the soil surface or from root sloughing and dissolved organic matter production below ground
- dead carbon pool is decomposed by "decomposers". Heterotrophic micobes (bacteria) and heterotropic organisms like earth worms
- carbon is respired back to $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$
- depicts aerobic respiration but anaerobic repiration takes place also. Anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen

### Biogeo chemical cycles
- are pathways for transformation and transport of matter within four areas that comprise the earth
- biosphere (_living things_): the living earth
- lithosphere (_crust_): soils, the solid or molten earth
- hydrosphere (_ocean_): liquid earth (cryo is the frozen)
- atmosphere (_least dense, less mass, easy to change_): gasous earth
