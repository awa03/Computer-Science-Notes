# Energy

- How is Energy transported around the planet
	- Atmospheric Circulation
	- Oceanic Circulation
- Energy _is the capacity to do work_
- Energy _can be neither created nor destroyed_
- Can be converted from one form to another
	- __Kinetic Energy__ (energy of motion)
	- __Potential Energy__
		- Positional energy
		- Energy in chemical bonds
		- Energy in electromagnetic radiation (light)
		- Energy in matter itself
- The first law of thermodynamics: _total amount of energy in the universe is constant_
	- But systems within the universe can gain or lose energy
	- When a vase hits the floor
		- Sound waves
		- Motions of pieces
		- Heat
- The second law of thermodynamics: _every energy transformation increases disorder (entropy)_ 
	- Energy tends to go from more usable to less usable forms
	- Least stable energy form is heat 
	- Heat is energy contained in random motion of molecules

## Types of Energy
- __Electromagnetic radiation__: light
	- Travels at the speed of light (186,000 miles/s)
	- Amount of energy determined by the wave length
	- _Electromagnetic spectrum_: Full range of wave lengths
- __Heat__: kinetic energy of moving molecules
	- _Temperature_: average kinetic energy of a collection of molecules
	- Transferred by:
		- Conduction: direct transfer of heat
		- Convection: warm (less dense) regions of gas or liquid rise
		- Radiation: matter loses heat by radiation, producing electromagnetic energy
		- Latent heat transfer: heat transfer associated with phase transition (melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation)
- __Chemical Energy__: potential energy associated with the formation or breakage of bonds between atoms
	- Photosynthesis converts electromagnetic radiation (sunlight into chemical energy (sugar))
- __Nuclear Energy__: the energy contained in an atoms nucleus
	- $E = mc^2$ ($Energy = Mass \times SpeedOfLight^2$)
	- Nuclear fission: splitting the nucleus
- Most of the earths energy is derived from electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun
- Radiates energy back into space (primarily as infrared radiation)

## Atmospheric Circulation
- Why is the earth so warm and other parts are cold?
	- The sun rays strike at different parts of the earth at different angles
	- Sunlight reaching tropical regions arrives nearly perpendicular to the surface. 
	- Sunlight reaching polar regions arrives at a oblique angle, which spreads over a larger area
- The _seasons_ are caused by the sun hitting the earth at non consistent angles
- Earth is _tilted_ 23.5 degrees
- In polar regions _heat radiation is greater than solar radiation_
- __Short wave Radiation__:
	- Solar 
- __Long wave Radiation__:
	- Heat 
- __Density__: mass / volume
	- usually constant for solids
	- can change significantly for fluids (and gasses)
	- __Altered by changes in temperature  and pressure__
	- increased temp = decreased density 
	- increased pressure = increased density
	- Less dense fluids want to rise above more dense ones, take for example hot air balloons
- The spinning planet force is known as the __Coriolis Effect__
- The ocean retains more heat than land
	- Oceans are typically warmer at night than land
	- During the day it is typically cooler
	- Sea breezes flow from sea to land during the day
- __Storms__
	- Areas of surface heating will lead to rising air
	- Rising air must be replaced by air from the surrounding areas
	- The area of rising air is known as a low pressure zone
	- Coriolis causes the moving air to spiral
	- Rising air cools, causing humid air to condense
	- Condensing air leads to cloud formation and potentially precipitation
- __Hurricanes (tropical cyclones)__: rotating mass of warm humid air 
	- Condensation of humid air in the hurricanes leads to the release of latent energy
	- Converted to wind energy
	- Requiring hot oceanic water

## Ocean Circulation
- Two important forms of ocean circulation
	- __Surface currents__: (wind driven circulation)
		- Rapid
		- High variable
	- __Deepwater flow__: (thermohaline circulation)
		- Overturning ocean
		- Long-term transport (1000 yr)
		- driven by dense sinking water
- Wind driven circulation
	- Wind transfers energy through friction
	- _Coriolis effect_ turns water to the right
	- Leads to _gyres_
	- __Gyre__: large system of rotating ocean current
- Water along the eastern boundaries of the ocean are typically colder because of _costal upwelling_
	- Brings cold, deep, nutrient rich water to the surface
- __Thermohaline cycle__:
	- Slow circulation of the deep ocean
	- Driven by density
	- Dense water sinks into polar regions
	- replaced by upwelling in other regions of the world
	- Redistributes heat around the globe
	- Large part of why Europe isnt covered in ice
