# Networking Foundations
- _network_: interconnects devices
- _personal area network_: PAN
- _local area network_: LAN
- _campus area network_: CAN
- _metropolitan area network_: MAN
- _wide area network_: WAN
- networks can be used to monitor devices
- Network interface card (NIC)
  - no other device should have the same mac address
  - vendor code within mac address
  - mac address is 48 bits
  - divided into vendor code and unique identifier
- subnet masks
- we have ran out of ipv4 devices
- network address translation (NAT)
- ipv4: $2^32$
- ipv6: $2^128$
- ethernet switch learns where to send address
- _flooding_: when a switch doesn't know where to send, sends to all ports except the one that recieved the frame
