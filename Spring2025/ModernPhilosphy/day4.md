## Spinoza
- no separation of intelligent will
  - everything is determined
  - Spinoza believed _intellect, the will has made a judgment_ was garbage
  - the affirmation is already in the intellect
  - when you see something is true, you don't have freedom to not (thus not bound by our will)
- bodies that are impressed dont just move
- if the human body has been effected by 2 bodies at once, he will recall 2 bodies
- we see some bodies more quickly, some more fast
  - _time_ thus comes from the idea of motion
- __Critiques of Previous Philosophers (Descartes ...)__
  - challenges the received wisdom of the western view
  - it was at one time acceptable to believe in god, but not anymore
	- cant believe nature as a purpose
	- critique of teleology
	- must think of logically, without normative value
  - all human action is part of the natural economy of things
- __Connection to Descartes__
  - accepted his definition of substance
  - propecity to existence
  - only a single distinct substance
  - refers to this subistance as _god_ or _nature_
  - his attempt to offer a rational spirituality
- __mind and body problem__
	- _attributes_: same thing described in different ways
	- can describe physically or in terms of a descriptive way of analysis (ideas)
	- we are only aware of the body and mind, there are _unlimited_ attributes
	- the mind and body are two different ways of describing the same phenomena  
	- does god have a mind, yes, it is within all of us
	- the mind of god is human rationality
- __if every cause is a logical implication, than every cause is determined.__
	- substance makes a being
	- behavior being completely determined
	- _determinism_
	- we are different in the fact we are much more complex, but man must be part of nature
	- free will is not real
	- stimulus response game
- __conadous__ (will to power)
	- will to power
	- like a _survival instinct_
- __principle of association__
	- associating stimuli with response
	- cause and effect, allowing for emotional predictability
- __passive emotion__: held passive to required phenomena, human bondage
	- mans lack of power to control and respond to emotions
	- determined by that which is outside of us
	- all in _human bondage_
	- _a way of salvation_: understanding the cause of them, when we see the necessity of judgments they lose their power on us

### Spinoza Ethics (pt. 1)



****

## Descartes
- intellect, the will has made a judgment

****

## Bacon
- __true induction vs common induction__
  - _true_: longer more deliberate way of induction, exploring every possibility
    - the same as common, without making generalizations
    - mother and cookies example
  - _common_: influenced by our biases (more so), guessing a pattern will likely continue
    - Aristotelian philosophy
    - more naive
- Descartes and Spinoza are more deductive than inductively making conclusions
- knowledge is power
- trying to convince kinds to building scientific institution's
- science is gods way of giving us power over nature
- rational method of learning the most basic principles of knowledge of things from our sensory expirence
- no insight to the inner essence of things by any means
- knowledge as a usuful way of navigating the world
- __Analysis vs Synthesis_
  - _analysis_: reducing some whole part and examining its parts individually
  - _synthesis_: combining parts together into a whole
  - these are opposite processes
  - complimentary within science
- __Induction vs Deduction__
  - _deduction_: process of beginning from a general statement, _premise_, and arriving at something that is logically true
    - begin with the conclusion and attempt to arrive at the premise.
  - _induction_: combine the premises to form the conclusion, __sythesis_
    - our dog has traits that resemble a dog, therefore he is a dog
    - never be sure of correctness, because all premises have not been explored (_true induction_)
- _syllogism_: said to be true if all premises are true (_syllogistic figures_) and therefore the conclusion must be true as well
  - asserts a necessary connection between premises regardless of the result
  - an argument is _sound_ if the premise's are true and if it is a valid argument
- _logically synthetic_: combines premises into a conclusion
****

## Galileo
- look at regimented rational method in order to learn basic principles
- only seek to interpret sensory expirence sensory expirence
  - we can free ourselves from illusion by looking to the senses directly to gain knowledge
