  - a proposition is true if and only if the concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject

- argues against descartes that extension cannot constitute the essence of any substance and rehabilitates substantial forms as the essence of the extended subject
- every substance must represent the whole universe from a certain point of view
- there will be a perfect agreement among substances, producing the same effect that would be noticed if they communicated through the transmition of qualities of species
