### Leibniz Notes (225 - 227)
- 1646 => 1716
- attended universities of Leipzig (1661 - 1666)
- graduating with a degree in law and philosophy
- __Works__
  - Discourse in Metaphysics
  - Dynamics
  - Monadology
  - New Essays on Human Understanding
- No one work that encompasses all of his ideals (like Descartes [meditations] or spinoza [ethics])
- __Concept containment theory of Truth__
  - a proposition is true if and only if the concept of the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject
  - the nature of an individual substance or of a complete being is to have a notion some complete that it is suffience to contain and allow us to deduce from it all the predicates of the subject to which this notion is attributed
  - two substances cannot resemble one another completely and differ only in numbers
- argues against descartes that extension cannot constitute the essence of any substance and rehabilitates substantial forms as the essence of the extended subject
- every substance must represent the whole universe from a certain point of view
- there will be a perfect agreement among substances, producing the same effect that would be noticed if they communicated through the transmition of qualities of species
- nothing in our mind that we are not actually concious of perceiving
  - doctrine of _petites perceptions_
  - at any moment there is an infinity of perceptions in us which we do not consciously perceive
  - the present is filled with the future and laden with the past
  - everything conspires together
  - death maybe a state similar to sleep
- power and knowledge under god have no limits
- I think what he is saying within this passage is that (_page 253_) is that things are not good we are questioning god
  - if this is what he is saying this is a terrible point LOL since that would mean we would have to be complacent to any issues within our lives
  - I think that it is rather we may not understand the purpose of things, so this would kind of negate the prior point.
  - more similar to descartes perspective I would say
- it seems he believe god always acts for a reason, and that these reasons may not be available to us but there is a reason for each action he makes
- the love of god requires our complete satisfaction and acquiescence with respect to what he has done with or without our being quietest as a result
- what the rules of perfection of diving conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the ways is in the balance with the richness of its effects
  - god choses the simplest laws to govern the universe
  - despite the simplicity the creation is incredibility rich and diverse
  - choses a combination of simplicity and complexity
    - so that less diverse and interesting universe
    - complex laws may reduce richness and diversity of phenomena
    - simple laws may lead to a less interesting universe
    - best possible world made by god
    - god has supreme wisdom and provides justification for universe

> I dont understand this line of thinking. I understand what he is saying but this really does seem nonsensical to me.

### Leibniz Notes (252 - 263)
- god is an absolutley perfect being
  - consequences of this statement are not considered
  - several perfections in nature
  - god possesses each perfection in its _highest form_
-

> [!NOTE]
> How can we have a _highest_ form of perfection, thats kind of opposed to the meaning of perfection

- fundamental units of reality are simple
- no interaction between the body and solul
- god has a preestablished harmony with everything, therefore there appears to be a causal relationship
- argued that our world is thebest world that god could have created, because he would not have built an imperfect world
  - spinoza made a similar argument
- if a proposition is true than its negation must be false
- sufficient reason: there must be a sufficient reason for anything to exist, any event to occur, or any truth to obtain
- law of continuity: nature does not make jumps
- evilness must suppose apparent flaws in every possible world (__so god isnt perfect??__, not what he said but really dude)
- in a true proposition the predicate is contained in the subject (ugh this is just bound by linguistics again.)
