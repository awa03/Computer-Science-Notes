- Matrial Gueroult description of meditations
	- work of art in two panels
	- __First Panel__
		- First three Meditations
		- ruled by the darkness of the principle of universal deception with a battle being fought against it by the truth of the existence of the self
		- a mere point of light 
	- __Second Panel__
		- ruled by the blinding light of Gods absolute veracity
		- the principle of universal truth
		- fought by the existence of error, a narrow point of darkness and seeming exception to that principle, puncturing the light of universal veracity in the same way that the existence of the self punctured darkness of universal deception
		- Triumph of light over darkness
	- __Single block of certainty__
- Meditations attempts a complete intellectual revolution
	- Replacement of Aristotelian philosophy with a new philosophy
	- In order to replace with a new science
	- The world (cold, heat, moistness, dryness, but also others) can be explained without needing to suppose a purpose anything in their matter other than the motion, size, shape, and arrangement of its parts.
	- No forms other than ones defined quantitatively
	- We have nothing to fear or to hope for after this life anymore than ants or flies do
	- Soul is of a nature entirely independent of the body, not subject to die with it
- _God_ and _Soul_ demonstrated with the aid of philosophy rather than theology
- Proven by natural reason
- Nothing is more ancient than the truth
- Aimed to prove gods existence through his natural reason
- Prove mind is distinct from the body
- The intent of _Discourse for Conducting One's Reason Well and for Seeking the Truth in Sciences_ was to offer a sample from the readers opinion to gauge reaction to his new ideas
- I think therefore I am, nothing known belong my essence 
- __First Mediation__
	- Reasons given why we can doubt all things
	- Greatest utility lies in freeing us from prejudice
- __Second Meditation__
	- I think therefore I am
	- The mind realizes it is impossible for it to not exist during this meditation
	- The annihilation of the mind does not follow from the decaying of the body
	- Mind is immortal
- __Third Meditation__
	- Our mind must be a creation of god
- __Fourth Meditation__
	- All that we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, falsity is also explained
	- No discussion of what is sin
	- Only errors occur in discriminating between true and falsehood
- __Fifth Meditation__
	- The existence of god is explained through a new proof
	- Show how it is true 
- __Sixth Meditation__
	- Understanding distinguished from imagination
	The mind proved to be distinct from the body
- Not having hands, eyes, flesh, blood or senses
	- Falsely believing we possess these things
	- These fool us into believing they are true
- Assume something is false until proven true certainly (scientific method mentioned???)
	- Suppose everything I see to be false
	- No senses
	- "What then will be true? Perhaps just the single fact that nothing is certain"
	- I must exist because even if god deceives me, I exists as long as I am to think that I am something
- __Then What am I?__
	- The power of self motion, and sensing or thinking don't belong the the nature of the body
	- Thoughts exist, nothing but a thinking thing. Mind, intellect, understanding, or reason
	- I am something...?
	- A thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, imagines, and senses
	- There is one thing I cannot doubt, and that is the fact that I am doubting
	- Even if we were being "tricked" this would presuppose that I do exist
	- I am real because it is a commonality within all human states, I am the actor so I exist
- __Is imagining the contemplation of shape or image of a thing?
- __Wax Example__
	- The wax changes form, and is not concrete yet it is still wax
	- A body that manifested itself to me in these ways
	- Recognition cannot come from the senses since different things are from before or after
	- The knowledge of the wax comes from intellect or reasoning. 
	- The wax's essence or sensory qualities is not essential to its nature
	- I perceive the wax through my mind, not its nature 

>[!Thoughts]
> I don't really think that the idea that items don't inherently possess a sensed form is very controversial at all. If I smell something in the kitchen and I think that's pasta, there must be some form of the mind in work identifying hey that smell maps to pasta in my brain. He's kind of just saying linguistics exist. 

- The wax exists for the very fact that I see it

>[!Possible Interpretation]
>I could be wrong, but I don't necessarily agree Descartes was saying a candle doesn't exist if we aren't "seeing it",
><blockquote>For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see it, certainly from this same fact that I see the wax it  follows  much  more  evidently  that  I  myself</blockquote>
> the wax does not change, rather it is not being classified so it does not hold the same value. Kind of like saying I got this gift card I can spend it because it isn't real money. While it is the same thing we are ascribing no value to the gift card because it isn't being observed as the same state. 
> <blockquote>If I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I imag-ine it, or for any other reason, plainly the same thing follow</blockquote>
> This candle in my hand does not possess the classification "smell" or feeling inherently. If I were to stop observing it the candle would not lose these traits, rather it is no longer classified as these observations because these observations are created by the mind.

- Derived what a thing, thought or truth is from its very nature
- 
- Deduction is always synthetic. 

>[!More Thoughts]
>So I am trying to reason about my interpretation, and I thought about the fire example. So it could seem that by my understanding it would be incorrect to say that the mind processes things and creates their form through our observed classification and ascribed value if we have no feeling in our arm, but we see its on the stove then why wouldn't we feel pain. I would like to present both a counter as well as a counter example to this in order to combat this understanding. This understanding presupposes what we mean by the mind. If the mind can be classify things through repeated observation it would follow that a hot stove would not hurt if you had no feeling, since you have either never experienced the __nature__ of the form, or if you lost sense at a later point the stimuli that is associated with the pain would be dominated by senses other than sight or smell. The counter example I would present would be that of phantom pain in people with missing limbs as well. The brain will often sense the feeling as if it were on the other limb. 


>[!Update]
>So after doing more research specifically within the [Michael Sugrue](https://youtu.be/_PSRVuQvVuU?si=U6tuals4L1pPpAlk) lectures I have learned that a large criticism of Descartes is that he conflates reality with linguistics. So I would say that I maybe gave him too much credit, but I was fairly on the money with my analysis. 

### Galileo
- Popularized heliocentric
	- Copernicus as well
	- Didn't have much evidence
- Condemned in 1633 
- Closely related to the church, knew how to work the church
- Aristotelian originally
- Invented telescope
- First Person to observe sunspots
	- Contrary to traditional views of infinite universe, and perfection by god
- Jupiter Belts 
- __The Dialog's and the Two Chief World System__
	- Condemned for this by the pope and many others
- Most of what is said about Galileo is false
- When you take away your senses there are still those properties per say but we cannot quantify them
- Secondaries are effects within the mind caused by the primary
	- Red 
	- White
	- Bitter
	- Sweet
- Primary maybe understood as things we can perceive objectively through senses. 
	- Shape
	- Solidity
	- Motion
- Stripping an object down to its bones
- Primary must belong to it because we cant think of something without it
