- Matrial Gueroult description of meditations
	- work of art in two panels
	- __First Panel__
		- First three Meditations
		- ruled by the darkness of the principle of universal deception with a battle being fought against it by the truth of the existence of the self
		- a mere point of light
	- __Second Panel__
		- ruled by the blinding light of Gods absolute veracity
		- the principle of universal truth
		- fought by the existence of error, a narrow point of darkness and seeming exception to that principle, puncturing the light of universal veracity in the same way that the existence of the self punctured darkness of universal deception
		- Triumph of light over darkness
	- __Single block of certainty__
- Meditations attempts a complete intellectual revolution
	- Replacement of Aristotelian philosophy with a new philosophy
	- In order to replace with a new science
	- The world (cold, heat, moistness, dryness, but also others) can be explained without needing to suppose a purpose anything in their matter other than the motion, size, shape, and arrangement of its parts.
	- No forms other than ones defined quantitatively
	- We have nothing to fear or to hope for after this life anymore than ants or flies do
	- Soul is of a nature entirely independent of the body, not subject to die with it
- _God_ and _Soul_ demonstrated with the aid of philosophy rather than theology
- Proven by natural reason
- Nothing is more ancient than the truth
- Aimed to prove gods existence through his natural reason
- Prove mind is distinct from the body
- The intent of _Discourse for Conducting One's Reason Well and for Seeking the Truth in Sciences_ was to offer a sample from the readers opinion to gauge reaction to his new ideas
- I think therefore I am, nothing known belong my essence
- __First Mediation__
	- Reasons given why we can doubt all things
	- Greatest utility lies in freeing us from prejudice
	- Free from all prejudices
	- Is there a complete reliable way of identifying the truth
	-
- __Second Meditation__
	- I think therefore I am
	- The mind realizes it is impossible for it to not exist during this meditation
	- The annihilation of the mind does not follow from the decaying of the body
	- Mind is immortal
- __Third Meditation__
	- Our mind must be a creation of god
- __Fourth Meditation__
	- All that we clearly and distinctly perceive is true, falsity is also explained
	- No discussion of what is sin
	- Only errors occur in discriminating between true and falsehood
- __Fifth Meditation__
	- The existence of god is explained through a new proof
	- Show how it is true
- __Sixth Meditation__
	- Understanding distinguished from imagination
	The mind proved to be distinct from the body
- Not having hands, eyes, flesh, blood or senses
	- Falsely believing we possess these things
	- These fool us into believing they are true
- Assume something is false until proven true certainly (scientific method mentioned???)
	- Suppose everything I see to be false
	- No senses
	- "What then will be true? Perhaps just the single fact that nothing is certain"
	- I must exist because even if god deceives me, I exists as long as I am to think that I am something
- __Then What am I?__
	- The power of self motion, and sensing or thinking don't belong the the nature of the body
	- Thoughts exist, nothing but a thinking thing. Mind, intellect, understanding, or reason
	- I am something...?
	- A thing that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, imagines, and senses
	- There is one thing I cannot doubt, and that is the fact that I am doubting
	- Even if we were being "tricked" this would presuppose that I do exist
	- I am real because it is a commonality within all human states, I am the actor so I exist
- __Is imagining the contemplation of shape or image of a thing?
- __Wax Example__
	- The wax changes form, and is not concrete yet it is still wax
	- A body that manifested itself to me in these ways
	- Recognition cannot come from the senses since different things are from before or after
	- The knowledge of the wax comes from intellect or reasoning.
	- The wax's essence or sensory qualities is not essential to its nature
	- I perceive the wax through my mind, not its nature

>[!Thoughts]
> I don't really think that the idea that items don't inherently possess a sensed form is very controversial at all. If I smell something in the kitchen and I think that's pasta, there must be some form of the mind in work identifying hey that smell maps to pasta in my brain. He's kind of just saying linguistics exist.

- The wax exists for the very fact that I see it

>[!Possible Interpretation]
>I could be wrong, but I don't necessarily agree Descartes was saying a candle doesn't exist if we aren't "seeing it",
><blockquote>For if I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I see it, certainly from this same fact that I see the wax it  follows  much  more  evidently  that  I  myself</blockquote>
> the wax does not change, rather it is not being classified so it does not hold the same value. Kind of like saying I got this gift card I can spend it because it isn't real money. While it is the same thing we are ascribing no value to the gift card because it isn't being observed as the same state.
> <blockquote>If I judge that the wax exists from the fact that I imag-ine it, or for any other reason, plainly the same thing follow</blockquote>
> This candle in my hand does not possess the classification "smell" or feeling inherently. If I were to stop observing it the candle would not lose these traits, rather it is no longer classified as these observations because these observations are created by the mind.

- Derived what a thing, thought or truth is from its very nature
- Deduction is always synthetic.

>[!More Thoughts]
>So I am trying to reason about my interpretation, and I thought about the fire example. So it could seem that by my understanding it would be incorrect to say that the mind processes things and creates their form through our observed classification and ascribed value if we have no feeling in our arm, but we see its on the stove then why wouldn't we feel pain. I would like to present both a counter as well as a counter example to this in order to combat this understanding. This understanding presupposes what we mean by the mind. If the mind can be classify things through repeated observation it would follow that a hot stove would not hurt if you had no feeling, since you have either never experienced the __nature__ of the form, or if you lost sense at a later point the stimuli that is associated with the pain would be dominated by senses other than sight or smell. The counter example I would present would be that of phantom pain in people with missing limbs as well. The brain will often sense the feeling as if it were on the other limb.

- __Why did he want to complete this goal?__
	- From seeing the world from many perspectives in the army
	- Reduce all of reality to mathematical things
	- There is a universal method to problem solving (mechanical philosophy)
	- He did not want to offend the Aristotelian's

>[!Update]
>So after doing more research specifically within the [Michael Sugrue](https://youtu.be/_PSRVuQvVuU?si=U6tuals4L1pPpAlk) lectures I have learned that a large criticism of Descartes is that he conflates reality with linguistics. So I would say that I maybe gave him too much credit, but I was fairly on the money with my analysis.

>[!Refining]
>Language binds our mind to our reality. If we can conclude our mind exists, and we can conclude that our reality must be understood through this mind. We understand that our mind is using language as a classification for commonalities. It is a generalization of what x is.

- the fact god created me makes it highly plausible i am created in his likeness
- We can understand that god exists through turning our minds eye in on itself, meaning that I perceive myself and strive for perfection, this concept that I am striving to achieve is thus dependent on another. This other person is god, since he is who I depend on to see these greater indefinite things.
	- Reasons from this that god cannot be a deceiver

## Meditation 4
- The mind is distinct from corporeal things
	- _corporeal things_ being things like a chair in concept, existing or manifesting in bodily form, material nature, tangible
- Existence depends on god at every moment
	- The human mind can know nothing more certain
- God cannot be deceiving me because deception is indicative of imperfection
	- The will of deception rests in malice
	- Not compatible with the idea of god
- Judgement was received from god
	- Since he does not wish to deceive me, he has not given me judgment where I can make a mistake when used properly
	- If I were to only think of god, and focus my attention towards him I would have no cause of error or falsity
	- We are not perfect because we lack many attributes of god
	- Our faculty is not infinite like gods, thus we have imperfections
- _Only I and God Exist_
- We cannot complain that the will that we were given or anything for that matter is imperfect because we are limited by the bounds of our experience
	- We can therefore not grasp anything greater
	- We bare a likeness or image to god
- divine grace, or natural reason _increases, and strengthens_ our freedom
- The indifference we feel when a choice cannot be made through reasoning drawing us towards an option is the _lowest grade of freedom_.
	- If we were to always see clearly what is true and good we would never have to wonder what choice to make
- We know we exist by a light that our intellect gave us, not because of some external force
- Guesses may persuade me to think in one direction but the knowledge that they are guesses pulls me away from them
- Hold off judgment till understanding something in its entirety, in order to understand them in their entirety
	- Therefore not _misusing our freedom_
	- Selecting false when the reality is true leads to an _error_
	- Selecting true when the reality is true leads to an _sheer luck that I happen upon the truth_
		- Not without fault
		- perception on the part of the intellect must always precede a determination on the part of will

> [!NOTE]
> Descartes is basically saying that if we assume something to be true, and it does in fact end up being true we are still in a fault of some kind because we did not use our intellect to determine this, rather blindly guessed and happened upon the correct answer

- out finite intellect does not understand many things
- shouldn't question why we don't have an infinite intellect, rather thank him for giving us one at all
- God has given me a will that has a wider scope than my intellect
- There is greater perfection in us being able to make errors
- _I should never judge anything that I do not clearly understand_
- Even if I cannot abstain from errors, I must attempt to avoid them in another way, by abstaining from making judgments whenever the truth of the matter is not important
- Through meditation I can acquire a habit of not erring
- __Clear Perception must be true__
	- For god is the author
	- and god cannot be deceitful

## Mediation 5
- it is not so much that we discover something new through observing particular rather recalling something we knew beforehand
	- It seems we aren't noticing things because we have not directed our mental gaze at them

> [!NOTE]
> Once again I don't really think much of what he is saying here, he is kind of just saying our eyes focus in on objects.

- __triangle example__
	- If I think of a triangle I did not fabricate it, it does not depend on my mind
	- We envision its nature
	- demonstrated through features (properties as he states)
	- We acknowledge these properties when we imagine the triangle, therefore it is not fabricated by me
	- Patently true because we know these clearly
- god must exist
	- I can envision god
	- and I cannot envision a mountain without a valley
	- just because I cannot envision a mountain without a valley doesn't mean one does not exist
	- Therefore it would be contradictory to say god does not exist because god as a substance exists, because we can envision him.
	- I am not free to think of god without existence
- Existence is one of gods perfections
- We must reason about our perceptions in order to categorize them
- We would acknowledge nothing more easily than god if not for prejudices
	- biases making us less receptive to arguments
	- ironically goes on to state because god is so evident no evidence can move me away from him
- _If anything is evident to my intellect then it is true_
	- Things can be true when you are asleep
	- Every science depends exclusively upon the knowledge of the true god
	- Proving god through reason
- things exist, at least in an object of pure mathematics

## Meditation 6
- I can be so mistaken by my nature that I might occasionally be mistaken about things that a perceive true
- If I can clearly and distinctly percieve something to be true then noothing can be said to make me doubt it
- _Cannot be mistaken in matters that I plainly understand__
  - Even if I am dreaming anything that is evident to my intellect is true
 - Science depends exclusively on the knowledge of the true God
 - Corporeal nature is the object of mathmatics
 - __Examining if material things exist__
   - They do since I clearly and distinctly precieve them
- Never judged god as incapable of doing something
  - except when it is incompatible with precieving it distinctly
- __Imagination vs.  Intellect__
  - Imagine a triangle (famous geometric proof)
  - Chiliagon (thosands of sides) we dont image every side like the triangle example
    - A more confused fashion of envisioning (thus not the actual thing)
  - Effort on the part of the mind in order to imagine
  - The power of imagination is not required for my own essence
    - Essence of the mind
  - The power of imagination depends on something within us, for if we did not have the power of imagination we would be the same person
  - __Intellect__: The mind looks inwards on itself to find ideas
  - __Imagination__: The mind turns to the body to find something that can be understood by the mind or by perception
      - The body exists (probably)
      - Can help develop an argument to prove the body exists
  - Imagination is messy
    - Our imagination is percieved better through sensory expirences
- Not without a reason that I thought I sensed things that manifested differently from my thought (bodies)
  - Came without my consent to exist
  - Cannot sense any object unless it is present to my sense organs
  - Cant fail  to sense it if it is present to me
  - It seems therefore impossible that they came from my self
  - Since I have no knowledge of things except from those same ideas themselves
- Not without reason did I judge that this body is mine
  - I can never be seperated from it
- Judgments from external senses are subject to error
  - Big building appears small from afar
  - Perhaps there is a faculty in me that produced perceptions


### Descartes RECAP (Provided by him LOL)
- hands, head, and feet (as well as other members) which I view as a part of me
- The body found among other bodies, and they can effect one another
- Sensed hardness, heat, other tactile qualities
- Sensed light, colors, odors, tastes, and sounds
- Distinguished sky, earth, seas, and other bodies from one another

> [!NOTE]
> This is fairly ironic given he needs to imagine not having imagination in order to conclude this



# In Class Review
- Unlike bacon, not using empirical analysis, rather a logical one
- Begins with can I doubt?
	- Can I be deceived when following the criteria of understanding if something is true
		- Senses
		- Dream argument
	- We cant take _"Im awake"_ as a basis of certainty
- When we think a chair or a table as something real there
	- We can only do this through our minds
	- The existence of external objects relys on our mind
		- Existence not reality
