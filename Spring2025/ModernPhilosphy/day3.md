# Spinoza (172-185)
- besides substances and modes nothing exists
- god doesn't love anything, rather just exists
   - there is a way to live according to him 
- god encompasses our idea of the self
	- god is infinite modes
	- the entirety of all intellect
	- everything exists at around the principle of motion and rest
- for a given determinate cause an effect must following
  - if no cause no effect will follow (similar to Newton)
- _knowledge_ of an effect depend on knowledge of cause
- things which have nothing in common with one another cannot be understood through one another
- if a thing can be conceived as not existing its essence does not involve existence
- Propositions
  - __Substance is by nature prior to its modification__
  - __Two substance having different attributes have nothing in common__
  - __When things have nothing in common, one cannot be the cause of the other__
	  - a body cannot create a mind, we can create a body that houses the mind. A mind cannot also create a body. 
  - __Two or more distinct things are distinguished from one another either by the difference of the attributes of the substances or by the difference of the affections of the substance__
	- nothing exists external to the intellect through which several things can be distinguished from one another
  - __In the universe there cannot be two or more substance of the same nature or attribute__
	- if distinguished by a difference of attributes, then cannot be more than one substance of the same attribute
	- if distinguished by a difference of affections then since substance by nature prior to affections
	- each mode is only a specific moment of one substance
  - __One substance cannot be produced by another substance__
	- one cannot be produced by another
	- exists nothing but substances and their affections
	- if a substance could be the knowledge would depend on the knowledge of the cause, thus not being a substance
	- 
  - __Existence belongs to the nature of substance__
	- cannot be produced by anything else
	- essence involves existence, existence belongs to nature
  - __Every substance is necessarily infinite__
	- cannot be more than one substance having attribute
	- therefore exist as finite or infinite
	- since finite is a negation, every substance must be infinite
	- truth external to the intellect is only in themselves
	- the existence of a substance in which there are no doubts of its existence is difficult
	- the existence of a substance is as much an external truth as its essence
	- the true definition of a thing involves and expresses nothing beyond the nature of the thing
	- no definition involves or expresses a fixed number of individuals, since it expresses nothing but the nature of the thing defined.
	  - the definition of a triangle expresses nothing but the nature of a triangle (not a fixed number of triangles)
	- must be a cause for an individual existence
	  - must be evident by nature and definition
	  - must havee its being independently of the thing itself
	- if substance wasnt infinite then there is something thats outside of it that presses against it
		- space for example
	- __a fixed number of individuals exist in nature_
	  - why not __more or less__
	  - cause for existence of each one (20 men example)
	  - each must be external to one another
	- definition of substance must involve existence
	  - existence of a subject _must be concluded from the definition_
  - __The more reality or being a thing has the more attributes it has__
		- Spinoza is trying to find a way to understand our ability for action  
  - __Each attribute of one substance must be conceived through itself__
	- for an attribute is that which intellect precises of substance as constituting its essence
  - __God, or substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which express eternal and infinite essence necessarily exists__
	- the reason a square circle does not exist is indicated by its nature, involves contradiction
  - __No attribute can be truly conceived from which it follows that substance can be divided__
    - we are parts of a substance
    - part of the same soup
  - __substance absolutely infinite is indivisible__
  - __Besides god no substance can be concieved__
     - because god is infinite there is no room for other substances
  - __whatever is is within god, god is infinite__
    - nothing is separate from god
    - fail to see how all things are beings of one substance
  - __god infinite nature implies infinite number of things in infinite number of ways to the infinite intellect__
    - if god is infinite therefore all possibility is infinite as well
  - __god acts in his own nature only and is compelled by no one__
    - humans can only make things exist but not provide their essence
  - __god is the imminent and not the transient cause of all things__
    - we are thinking of things that exist but our totality is god, cannot deify god 
  - __god is eternal, all his attributes are eternal__
  - __gods existence and essence are the same__
  - __all things attached to any of gods attributes must exist__
  - __anything that follows from this attribute is nessicarily infinite__
  - __any mode that is infinite emerges from infinite attribute__
    - infinite cannot come from finite
  - __the essence of things produced by god does not involve existence__ 
  - __god is not only the efficent cause of the existence of thing but also their essence__
    - god creates essence and existence
  - __something acts in a particular way has to be caused by gods will__
  - __a thing which has been determined by god cannot render itself indeterminate__
    - everything determined by god
  - __infinite chain of cause and effect__
  - __no one of these finite causes can come from infinite attributes unless comes from god__
  - __in nature nothing is contingent everything is determined by divine nature__
  - __the actual intellect must comprehend the attributes of god and nothing else__
    - the idea of god must have come from god
    - we are modifications of gods intellect
  - __the natura naturata refers to actual intellect along with things like love is dependent on god, and does not cause itself__
  - __the will cannot be caused a free cause and it is necessary__
    - determined by cause
  - __things could have been produced by god in no other order__
    - if someone suggested it be different that would imply it is imperfect
  - __the power of god is his essence itself_
  - __whatever we percieve to be in gods power must exist__
  - __nothing exists whos nature and exist does not follow__
    - must produce some effect (even if only taking up space)
- we can only understand something by the way it came to existence
- if something does not have an essence it does not exist
	- we can have essence without __existence__ 


  ### Definitions (given on 172)
  - _self caused_: whose essence involves existence, whos nature can be conceived only as existing
  - _a thing_: can be said to be finite in its own kind
	- a body, because we can always convince of another body greater than it.
	- limited by another thought
  - _a substance_: conceived through itself, conception does not require conception of another thing.
	- a cause in itself
  - _an attribute_: thought of the mind or extension of the body
  - _finity_: bounded by limit
  - _mode_: the affections of a substance
	- something else conceived through something else
  - _god_: absolutely infinite being (__You can see Descartes influence lol__)
	- external and infinite essence
  - _absolutely infinite_: infinite attributes
  - _infinite in its kind_: one may deny that it has infinite attributes
  - _free_: exists solely from the necessity of its own nature, determined to action by itself
	  - it determines itself
	  - all determined by the laws of cause and effect
  - _eternity_: existence itself as conceived following from the definition of an eternal thing
	- existence is conceived as an external truth
	- cannot be explicated through duration of time
  - _axioms_: all things that are
  - a thought cannot be limited by a body


# Ethics (Dr. Darren Staloff)
- challenged the notion of god and free will
- rational skeptical mind
- now with modern science we should question god
  - why would go care about us
- rejected things have purposes (teleology)
  - hubirus to thing, cosmos came about to serve my purposes
  - the world is a physical pheneomina
  - no purpose to be forfilled, simply the substance working itself out to the effect
- if we are in nature
  - all human action is part of the natural economy
  - logically and scientifically explainable
  - Descartes methods were profoundly impactful on spinoza
  - as well as his definitions of substance
	- propensity for existance
	- more than one of them?
- one substance (the universe / world)
  - famous contrast to Descartes dualism
  - _this substance is god or nature (Spinoza)_
  - his attempt at offering a rational spirituality
- if one substance what about body and mind?
  - the same thing but described in 2 ways: _attributes_
  - (chess example, biologically vs chess perspective)
  - can add more descriptions to get more attributes
  - cannot assume they are not the same thing, we are only aware of 2 of these attribute.
  - there are an infinite amount of attributes
- not all of nature can be described in terms of mind
- does go have a mind?
  - yes, but there is no god outside of us and nature
  - god is human rationality
  - which is the same as the human body
- the causal nexus (what bind world together)
  - every cause is nessicary
  - the universe knows no randomness
  - everything that happens and will happen is set
  - __determinism__
- if man is part of nature his choices are determinable
  - we don't have free will
  - determined by education, training, etc
  - our choices are not random, something determined them
  - otherwise it was irrational
- if we have all of the neurology and ideas we can predict human action
- within every organic entity is a will for survival
  - everything attempts to have as much potency as possible
  - __principle of association_
- we respond to stimulus and response
- what is human happiness
  - the well being of the animal
  - more power
	- strength
	- stature
  - so happiness is creating as much power for yourself as possible
- life is outside of our hands if we respond to passive emotions
  - __human bondage__: mans lack of power to control their emotions
  - to break we need to understand the cause
- the only thing we can control is our emotional states
  - remaining a calm charming person
- universal rational love
- stoic influences??? (Marcus Aurelius specifically)
- the ultimate expression of the power is to love everyone even your enemies
  - this is the way of salvation
- apply spirituality to the world, that is the way of liberation
