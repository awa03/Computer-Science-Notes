# Spinoza (172-185)
- for a given determinate cause an effect must following
  - if no cause no effect will follow (similar to Newton)
- _knowledge_ of an effect depend on knowledge of cause
- things which have nothing in common with one another cannot be understood through one another
- if a thing can be conceived as not existing its essence does not involve existence
- Propositions
  - __Substance is by nature prior to its affections__
  - __Two substance having different attributes have nothing in common__
  - __When things have nothing in common, one cannot be the cause of the other__
  - __Two or more distinct things are distinguished from one another either by the difference of the attributes of the substances or by the difference of the affections of the substance__
    - nothing exists external to the intellect through which several things can be distinguished from one another
  - __In the universe there cannot be two or more substance of the same nature or attribute__
    - if distinguished by a difference of attributes, then cannot be more than one substance of the same attribute
    - if distinguished by a difference of affections then since substance by nature prior to affections
  - __One substance cannot be produced by another substance__
    - one cannot be produced by another
    - exists nothing but substances and their affections
    - if a substance could be the knowledge would depend on the knowledge of the cause, thus not being a substance
  - __Existence belongs to the nature of substance__
    - cannot be produced by anything else
    - essence involves existance, existance belongs to nature
  - __Every substance is necessarily infinite__
    - cannot be more than one substance having attribute
    - therefore exist as finite or infinite
    - since finite is a negation, every substance must be infinite
    - truth external to the intellect is only in themselves
    - the existance of a substance in which there are no doubts of its existance is difficult
    - the existence of a substance is as much an external truth as its essence
    - the true definition of a thing involves and expresses nothing beyond the nature of the thing
    - no definition involves or expresses a fixed number of individuals, since it expresses nothing but the nature of the thing defined.
      - the definition of a triangle expresses nothing but the nature of a triangle (not a fixed number of triangles)
    - must be a cause for an individual existence
      - must be evident by nature and definition
      - must havee its being independently of the thing itself
    - __a fixed number of individuals exist in nature_
      - why not __more or less__
      - cause for existence of each one (20 men example)
      - each must be external to one another
    - definition of substance must involve existence
      - existence of a subject _must be concluded from the definition_
  - __The more reality or being a thing has the more attributes it has__
  - __Each attribute of one substance must be concieved through itself__
    - for an attribute is that which intellect percieves of substance as constituting its essence
  - __God, or substance consisting of infinite attributes, each of which express eternal and infinite essecnce necessarily exists__



  ### Definitions (given on 172)
  - _self caused_: whose essence involves existence, whos nature can be concieved only as existing
  - _a thing_: can be said to be finite in its own kind
    - a body, because we can always convieve of another body greater than it.
    - limited by another thought
  - _a substance_: concieved through itself, conception does not require conception of another thing.
  - _mode_: the affections of a substance
    - something else concieved through something else
  - _god_: absolutely infinite being (__You can see Descartes influence lol__)
    - external and infinite essence
  - _absolutely infinite_: infinite attributes
  - _infinite in its kind_: one may deny that it has infinite attributes
  - _free_: exists solely from the necessity of its own nature, determined to action by itself
  - _eternity_: existence itself as concieved following from the definition of an eternal thing
    - existence is conceived as an external truth
    - cannot be explicated through duration of time
  - _axioms_: all things that are


# Ethics (Dr. Darren Staloff)
- challenged the notion of god and free will
- rational skeptical mind
- now with modern science we should question god
  - why would go care about us
- rejected things have purposes (teleology)
  - hubirus to thing, cosmos came about to serve my purposes
  - the world is a physical pheneomina
  - no purpose to be forfilled, simply the substance working itself out to the effect
- if we are in nature
  - all human action is part of the natural economy
  - logically and scientifically explainable
  - Descartes methods were profoundly impactful on spinoza
  - as well as his definitions of substance
    - propensity for existance
    - more than one of them?
- one substance (the universe / world)
  - famous contrast to Descartes dualism
  - _this substance is god or nature (Spinoza)_
  - his attempt at offering a rational spirituality
- if one substance what about body and mind?
  - the same thing but described in 2 ways: _attributes_
  - (chess example, biologically vs chess perspective)
  - can add more descriptions to get more attributes
  - cannot assume they are not the same thing, we are only aware of 2 of these attribute.
  - there are an infinite amount of attributes
- not all of nature can be described in terms of mind
- does go have a mind?
  - yes, but there is no god outside of us and nature
  - god is human rationality
  - which is the same as the human body
- the causal nexus (what bind world together)
  - every cause is nessicary
  - the universe knows no randomness
  - everything that happens and will happen is set
  - __determinism__
- if man is part of nature his choices are determinable
  - we don't have free will
  - determined by education, training, etc
  - our choices are not random, something determined them
  - otherwise it was irrational
- if we have all of the neurology and ideas we can predict human action
- within every organic entity is a will for survival
  - everything attempts to have as much potency as possible
  - __principle of association_
- we respond to stimulus and response
- what is human happiness
  - the well being of the animal
  - more power
    - strength
    - stature
  - so happiness is creating as much power for yourself as possible
- life is outside of our hands if we respond to passive emotions
  - __human bondage__: mans lack of power to control their emotions
