# Security and Protection
- __Security__: policy (_what will be done_) of authorizing accesses
  - prevents intentional misuses of the system
- __Protection__: mechanisms (_how something will be done_) implemented to enforce the specialized policy
    - prevents accidental and intentional misuses
- _Confidentiality_: secret data remains secret
- _Integrity_: unauthorized users should not be able to modify data
- _Availability_: nobody can make a system unusable
- Encryption
  - Uses a key to transform the data
  - Difficult to reverse without the key
- UNIX stores encrypted passwords in `/etc/passwd`
  - uses one way transformers
  - required only lower-case, 5 letter passwords
  - require more complex password
- __Private key__ encryption of data
  - Encrypt(key, plaintext) = Cipher text
- __Eavesdropping__: listeners approach
  - tap into the ethernet and see everything
  - countermeasure: pressurize cables
- Abuse of privilege:
  - if the superuser is evil, not much you can do
- Imposter: breaks into the system by pretending to be someone else
  - recorded voice and facial image
  - countermeasure: behavioral monitoring to look for suspicious activities
- Trojan horse: seemingly innocent program performs an unexpected function
  - spyware is a variation that download ads, create popup windows and steal user information
  - countermeasure: integrity checking
- Salami attack: builds up an attack one-bit at a time
  - partial pennies to a bank account
  - countermeasure: code reviews
- Logic Bombs: a programmer secretly insert a piece of code into production system
- Denial of Service attacks: aim to reduce system availability
  - throttle the system
  - randomware: can encrypt important files until a random is paid
  - countedmeasure: versioned backup
