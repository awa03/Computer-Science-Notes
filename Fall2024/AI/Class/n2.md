$$\forall X \forall Y(X=Y \implies Y = X)$$

If we remove the qualifiers X and Y are indeterminate. True or false only applies to closed expressions.

1. P is closed and $v_1$(P) = T, or
2. P is not closed and $v_1$($P^\prime$) = T for all closed instances $P^\prime$ in $I$.

If we have axioms and inference rules than we have a way of generating theorems.  

*Modus Ponens*: From P and P -> Q infer Q
*Modus Tollens*: From P -> Q and ¬Q -> ¬P

All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal.
$\forall X(man(X) \implies mortal(X)) and man(socrates), then.. mortal(socrates)$

This substitution process is called *Unification*. Can also be found under universal identification. What complicates this process is variables. Variables can represent other functions, any term, or arbitrary complexity.
