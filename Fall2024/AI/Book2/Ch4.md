# Production System Search in Prolog

A _production system_ is a model of computation that is important for implementing search algorithms and modeling human problem solving behavior. 
- Provides Pattern Directed control of a problem solving process
- consists of a set of _production rules_, _working memory_, and a _recognize-act_ control cycle
- __Production Rules__
	- set of production rules is called _productions_.
	- A condition-action pair, defines a single chunk of problem solving knowledge
	- The _condition part_ of the rule is a pattern that determines when that rule may be applied by matching data in the working memory
	- The _action part_ defines the associated problem solving step
- __Working Memory__ 


























#### __Summary of A Production System__ 

A production system is important for modeling human tasks and search algorithms. It consists of _production rules_, _a working memory_, and a _recognize act_ control cycle. The production rules define how the problem should be approached. While the Working memory contains a description of the state of the world, this may include all moves made, or any information that will assist in solving the problem. The recognize act cycle then is the control structure for the production system.
