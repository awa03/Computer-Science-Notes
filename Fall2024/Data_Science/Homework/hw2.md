|                            | Treatment Consideration          | Complete resection for local recurrence/metastasis shows a survival advantage; debulking surgery may be useful but needs further clinical study                                       |
| **Additional Information**  | Incidence of Distant Metastasis  | Estimated to be approximately 5% in thymomas, with skeletal muscle metastasis being extremely rare                                                                                   |
|                            | Imaging Tools                    | MRI and FDG-PET are useful for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis; MRI characteristics compatible with thymoma were smooth contour, round shape, and distinct capsule         |
|                            | Histology and Prognosis Factors   | Histological subtype and extrathoracic metastasis impact prognosis; presence of extrathoracic metastasis may be more predictive of survival than Masaoka stage IV classification       |
