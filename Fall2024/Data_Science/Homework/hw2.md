|                            | Treatment Consideration          | Complete resection for local recurrence/metastasis shows a survival advantage; debulking surgery may be useful but needs further clinical study                                       |
| **Additional Information**  | Incidence of Distant Metastasis  | Estimated to be approximately 5% in thymomas, with skeletal muscle metastasis being extremely rare                                                                                   |
|                            | Imaging Tools                    | MRI and FDG-PET are useful for detecting lymph node and distant metastasis; MRI characteristics compatible with thymoma were smooth contour, round shape, and distinct capsule         |
|                            | Histology and Prognosis Factors   | Histological subtype and extrathoracic metastasis impact prognosis; presence of extrathoracic metastasis may be more predictive of survival than Masaoka stage IV classification       |

### Merging Tables in Claude 
Certainly. I'll merge the information from all four tables, consolidating duplicate or similar information into a single comprehensive table. Here's the consolidated table:

| Category | Sub-category | Details |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 1. Thymoma Overview | Definition | - Most common thymic epithelial tumor, typically arising in the mediastinum |
| | Classification | - Categorized into types A, AB, B1, B2, and B3 according to WHO classification |
| | | - Type B2 considered moderate/high-risk tumor |
| | Metastasis patterns | - Usually confined to thoracic organs (e.g., pleura, lungs, thoracic lymph nodes) |
| | | - Extrathoracic metastases are extremely rare (estimated 3-5% incidence) |
| | | - Previously reported in liver, kidney, bone, and lymph nodes |
| | | - Skeletal muscle metastasis is exceptionally rare |
| 2. Case Presentation | Patient demographics | - 84-year-old male |
| | Medical history | - Type B2 thymoma resection 14 years prior |
| | | - Small stable lung nodule identified 5 years after thymoma resection |
| | Presenting symptoms | - Right posterior thigh mass present for 4 years |
| | | - Gradual growth of the thigh mass |
| | Physical examination findings | - 3 × 3 cm painless mass in posterior thigh |
| | | - Smooth, nonadherent overlying skin without redness or heat |
| | | - Full range of motion in right hip and knee |
| 3. Diagnostic Workup | Imaging studies | - Plain radiographs: No calcification or scalloping of femur |
| | | - MRI: Lesion in semimembranosus muscle |
| | | - T1WI: Low intensity |
| | | - T2WI: Iso- to high intensity |
| | | - Enhanced after gadolinium-based contrast administration |
| | Biopsy results | - Oval to polygonal neoplastic cells with small round-to-oval nuclei |
| | | - Variable amounts of lymphocytes |
| | | - Confirmed type B2 thymoma metastasis |
| | Differential diagnosis | - Neurogenic tumors |
| | | - Malignant soft tissue lesions (e.g., myxofibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma) |
| 4. Treatment and Outcome | Surgical intervention | - Wide resection with 1-cm margin, 3 weeks after biopsy |
| | Follow-up results | - No local recurrence observed after 1 year |
| 5. Discussion | Rarity of extrathoracic metastasis | - Thymoma represents 40% of all mediastinal tumors |
| | | - Only one previous case of skeletal muscle metastasis (biceps brachii) reported |
| | MRI characteristics | - Smooth contour, round shape, distinct capsule |
| | | - Varying low signal foci within high-signal-intensity mass on T2WI |
| | | - Heterogeneous intensity on T2WI associated with tumor aggressiveness |
| | Treatment strategies for metastatic thymoma | - Complete resection for local recurrence or metastasis |
| | | - Debulking surgery may provide survival advantage |
| | | - Efficacy of surgery for extrathoracic extension still unclear |
| | Prognosis factors | - Affected by histological subtype and presence of extrathoracic metastasis |
| | | - Surgery groups show better overall survival in stage IV thymoma |
| 6. Additional Information | Imaging tools | - FDG-PET useful for detecting lymph node and distant metastases |
| | | - Can help distinguish low-risk thymoma from carcinomas |
| 7. Key Takeaways | | - Thymoma metastasis to skeletal muscle is extremely rare |
| | | - Consider thymoma metastasis in differential diagnosis for soft tissue tumors in elderly patients with thymoma history |
| | | - Complete resection or debulking surgery may provide survival advantage |
| | | - Long-term follow-up is warranted due to the rarity of this presentation |

This consolidated table combines the information from all four responses, eliminating duplicates and organizing the data into a comprehensive overview of the case report.
