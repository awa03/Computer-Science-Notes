### Testify in Court as an Expert Witness

The forensic scientist will need to testify. **Testimony** is the verbal statement of a witness, under oath, to the judge or jury. They are supposed to be expert witness to the facts of the case, but also give an opinion on what these results imply, not their personal thoughts on the case. In order to be considered an expert witness a forensic scientist must have a well documented background as well as education and training experience.
