# Data Notes

- **Digital Data** is information stored on a device or transferred over a network in binary form as a series of 1's and 0's. 
- The most basic and fundamental piece of information is referred to as a "bit"  
- A standard command for a computer is made up of eight bits and is called a byte


## Sectors 

- the smallest section of a hard drive that is accessible to the file system of disk

## Magnetic
- Most common storage media today
- Changing rapidly
- Tape
- Hard drives
- Magnetic medium
- Read - write head
	- Very close to the magnetic surface
	- Detect and change the magnetism of the medium
- Two magnetic polarities
	- Binary data -> 1 or 0
- Floppy disks, and CD 

## Flash Media
- Cons: 
	- Capacity doesn't match magnetic HDD
	- Unclear how long data will last
	- Memory wear
	- Weird read / write schemes
		- Block erasure
		- Garbage collection

## Magnetic and Flash Drives

- Sata
- IDE 
- Fibre - enterprise
- SAS - Serial Attached SCSI
	- SCSI commands, SATA data and power cables
	- New protocol allows for faster data transfer

## Optical Media

1. poly-carbonate disc layer has the data encoded by using lands and pits
2. Reflective layer reflects the laser back
3. A lacquer layer is used to prevent oxidation
4. Artwork is screen printed on the top of disk
5. A laser beam is used to read the data
6. Inorganic dye can be used to make cd's rewriteable
