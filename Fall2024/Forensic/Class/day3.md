# Legal role of the Digital Forensic Analyst

- Forensic analysts are not lawyers
- Legal questions need to be answered by lawyers
- The end game of all our work is Testimony in court

### What is Digital Forensics all about?

<blockquote>The analysis of digital media for the presence or absence of
digital evidence – data that is useful to an investigation (criminal or civil) -
the extraction and preservation of that data, and the presentation of that
data in a readable format</blockquote>


### What is Evidence?

- available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or a proposition is true or valid
- not really a legal term
- Lawyers present prospective evidence and the judge determine's if its admissible

### Digital Forensics / Investigation

- Digital Forensic Analyst versus Criminal Investigator
	-  Non-sworn versus sworn
	- Roles and Responsibilities
	- Legal abilities

### Expert Witness

1. Training or experience
2. Makes the evidence more accessible or understood by the trier of facts
3. Court may admit them as an expert witness
	- Experts can give opinions and interpretations in court
	- Defined and Regulated under the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 702

### Voir Dire

- Several definitions including:
	- Questions asked of potential Jurors to determine possible bias or conflicts
	- Series of questions asked by the attorney to determine the qualifications and comptence of an expert witness
	- Any hearing outside the presence of the Jury

### Scientific Evidence
- Difficult for judges and juries to understand
- Cant be an expert in all things
- Difficult to determine if someone is an expert or their science is valid

### Frye Standard

- Based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of polygraph as evidence.
- General acceptance test to determine the admissibility of evidence. Provides that expert opinion based on a scientific technique. Generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community.


### Daubert Standard

- In the landmark Supreme court case Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, in 1993 the court ruled that Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence did not incorporate the Frye "general acceptance" test as a basis for assessing the admissibility of scientific expert testimony.
-  Instead it ruled that the rule incorporated a flexible reliability standard instead. 
- Guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony:
	- **Judge is a gatekeeper:** Under Rule 702, the task of "gatekeeping", or assuring that scientific expert testimony truly proceeds from "scientific knowledge", rests on the trial judge
	- **Relevance and reliability:** This requires the trial judge to ensure that the expert's testimony is "relevant to the task at hand" and that it rests "on a reliable foundation".
- Scientific knowledge = scientific method / methodology: A conclusion will determine that the product of sound "scientific methodology" derived from the scientific method
- **Frye**
	- Relies on the scientific community to determine what is “generally accepted” science
	- Judges role as gatekeeper is limited – rely on the scientific community
- **Daubert**
	- If a method is relevant, reliable and follows the rules of evidence it does not have to be “generally accepted as reliable” to be admissible
	- Judges role as gatekeeper is much more liberal

### Search Warrant Issues

- The search warrant give law enforcement the authority to search based on probable cause and signed off on by a judge
- Protect citizens from unlawful search and seizure (4th amendment)
- **Often Defines:**
	- What may be searched
	- Who may do the searching
	- Where the search is to take place
	- A general time frame in which the search must be conducted
- “When electronic storage media are to be searched because they store information that is evidence of a crime, the items to be seized under the warrant should usually focus on the content of the relevant files rather than the physical storage media” (Searching and Seizing Computers and Obtaining Evidence in Criminal Investigations, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C (3rd ed 2009) at 72)
