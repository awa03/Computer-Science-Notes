- Must be documented
- Maintain consistent work through lab to lab
- Revised periodically
- Exceptions to the Standard Operating Procedure may be granted on a case by case basis.

### Best Practices Include

- **Quality Control**: Documentation, Quality, Proof of Quality of Work
- **Validation Testing**: Maintain a list of validated and approved tools
- **Proficiency Testing**: Verifiable, Maintain proficiency, Keep up with new technology, Testing the System, Testing the Individual.
- **Documentation**: Everything must be carefully documented

### Training

- A clear and well defined training program should be in place
- A qualified trainer should be designated
- Training should cover all the fundamentals of the discipline with competency tests to demonstrate mastery of each topic
- Should include overview of Forensic Science and scientific method
- Public speaking & courtroom testimony
- Should have a well defined start and end date
- Ongoing training is critical to maintaining proficiency in this field
- Training plans and requirements should be written down and clearly understood
- Can be internal and external as long as trainers are qualified

### Examination Environment

- Adequate power and cooling is required
- Work space free of contamination
- Limited or Controlled access
- Mechanisms should be in place to prevent cross contamination
- Workstations should be powerful enough to run the tools, should provide enough ports of various kinds
- In most cases should allow examiner access to os
- Familiar pc to analyst
- Cables and batteries
- Write blockers, adapters, and storage media
- Need Documentation tools


### Preparing to Begin Analysis
- Review any documentation submitted
	- Search Warrant
	- Consent to search
	- Service Request

### Standard Operating Procedure

- **The purpose of a SOP is to** create a clear set of guidelines for analysts to follow, set limitations and requirements that must be met, keeps everyone in their lane, inform observes
- **Scope of your lab resources**: equipment, capability of the personnel
- **Not every situation can be addresses**: specific enough for clear guidance, vague enough to allow some flexibility. Don't box yourself in.
- **If you want people to do it** - write it in the sop
- **Ensure there are ways to create revisions**, and handle how often they can occur.
- **Make different sections to address each process or major points**
- **Number each section**, also include references to other sections

### Chain of Custody
- Critical component 
- All transfers must be documented
- Who has/had possession of the items and when is critical
- Cross contamination
- Tampering
- Documentation should at minimum:
	- Date / Time
	- Location / Person From and To
	- Accurate description of the item
