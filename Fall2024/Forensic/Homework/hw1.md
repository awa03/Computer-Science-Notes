# Who Do I Work For? | Outline
**Aiden Allen**

### Slides 1-3: Introduction

Use possible ideas for who may be the boss in order to capture attention. I am also going to include a joke about the show The Boss in order to hook the audience. Then further engage the audience through a bright red X through the image and exclaim "None of them." 

### Slides 4-9: Science | The Boss of Scientists

Introduce my claim that science is the boss of forensic scientists. I will make a formal argument rather than simply stating "Science is the boss." My argument will begin with introducing forensic science as a science. I will prove this through their devotion to the scientific method, as well as the strict methodologies that forensic scientists must follow.

Following this claim, I will state that the goal of science is to present the objective truth. Science attempts to explain the world and phenomena around us; therefore, it is in the best interest of science to be objective.

Then I will reinforce this statement by concluding that forensic science is a science; therefore, forensic science is governed by the rules of science. This logically implies that forensic science should avoid implicit biases that could arise if it were governed by any entity other than science itself.

We can also observe and reiterate some of these claims through examples related to the Sixth Amendment.

I also want to introduce the claim that forensic science is a developing science, meaning that it is subject to more scrutiny. This further explains the importance of avoiding biases, as well as ensuring that proper procedures are followed.

### Source Page

I want this slide to be simple, including a quote from my source. I hope to demonstrate that science should be unbiased, and I will provide a reputable source for this purpose.
